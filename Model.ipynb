(spoke in Spanish): It is an honour for me to take the floor on behalf of the 21 Latin American and Caribbean countries that belong to the Rio Group. Our countries commend you on the organization of this meeting, the considerable participation in which reflects the importance of the subject. We also commend you for having encouraged the presence of civil society in this meeting, whose participation enriches the debate. We are convinced of the important contribution of civil society in the fight against HIV. We are working closely with national and international organizations, which perform an irreplaceable task at the community and implementation levels by participating as valid brokers in defining strategies and policies. I would also like to stress that many of our Group\\u2019s delegations include not only Government representatives and parliamentarians but also members of civil society and people living with HIV. The link between development and HIV/AIDS is clear. Apart from constituting one of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), fighting AIDS and reducing its negative social and economic consequences contribute to the achievement of other MDGs, such as gender equality, the empowerment of women, reducing infant mortality and improving maternal health. In our countries nearly 2 million people live with HIV. In Latin America the rate of prevalence continues to be relatively stable, but in the Caribbean it is growing. While our region has the highest rates of access to antiretroviral medicines in the developing world, the challenge for our countries is to prevent new infections, to provide treatment, care and support, as well as to reintegrate HIV-positive people into economic and social activity. Since the Assembly addressed the issue of HIV/AIDS in 2001, the Rio Group has emphasized the need to achieve universal access to treatment. We have witnessed great progress since the 2001 Declaration of Commitments, when the goal of universal access was considered impossible. We believe that goal is achievable, and recognize universal access as an integral part of guaranteeing human rights and fundamental freedoms that our peoples should enjoy. However, we still need to make use of cooperative and innovative mechanisms towards reducing the price of antiretroviral medicines, especially bearing in mind that these represent the majority of the total resources that we allocate to the epidemic. Similarly, we underline the importance of defining specific solutions for middle-income countries, ensuring that the initiatives to fight HIV/AIDS truly correspond to the challenges of our countries, where there are serious problems of inequality and poverty and where more than 40 per cent of people live on less than $2 a day. In our 3 region, we still need to increase access to second- and third-line antiretroviral medicines, the prices of which, I stress, we need to reduce. Over the past two years, we have seen that those prices are not set in stone and it is possible to reduce them. The Rio Group recognizes the significant progress reached in the 2006 Political Declaration, especially the idea that the WTO Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights should not be an obstacle to countries taking measures now or in the future to protect their citizens\\u2019 public health and the provision to assist developing countries in benefiting from the flexibility set out in the WTO Agreement. Moreover, the fact that in 2007 only 40 per cent of young men and 36 per cent of young women had clear and accurate knowledge about HIV/AIDS must serve both as a warning and as a guide for prevention activities. The needs of young people should therefore be taken into account in designing and implementing policies and strategies relating to the epidemic at the national level for both the health and education sectors. In that regard, education about HIV/AIDS and prevention continue to be the best strategies to reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS. Strategies in that regard should be comprehensive, evidence-based, aimed at vulnerable groups and include psycho-affective aspects and self-esteem. The goal should be that, by 2010, at least 95 per cent of young people will have accurate knowledge about HIV/AIDS. In many cases, stigmatization, discrimination and homophobia have prevented open discussion of the subject, thereby creating a culture of secrecy, silence and shame and diminishing the results of efforts to promote effective measures aimed at prevention, care and support. It is necessary to break that cycle with clear, transparent and unbiased information, as well as with legislation that promotes equality. It is true that the factors behind the growth of the epidemic can vary from country to country, or even within countries. There is therefore a need for increased resources to make detection tests more accessible, while at the same time developing studies that make it possible to identify and quantify the impact of the epidemic among various population groups, with a view to focusing and implementing responses appropriate to the needs of all groups. Nevertheless, strategies aimed at preventing and combating HIV/AIDS must adhere strictly to the human rights of people living with HIV. They must also combat stigmatization, discrimination and homophobia, which especially affect women, girls and children living with HIV, young men, men who have sex with men, intravenous drug users, male and female commercial sex workers, prisoners, migrants, people in conflict and post-conflict situations and refugees. Their full access to health services, including sexual and reproductive health, must be ensured. We know that there are still pending issues on the agenda, including preventing mother-to-child transmission, which should be fully attainable. It is therefore necessary to double or even treble our efforts to achieve it. There is also a need to reduce the feminization of the pandemic and to continue and strengthen initiatives aimed at development and research into drugs, vaccines and microbicides, which require both financial resources and political will. We must also ensure the sustainability of the response to HIV/AIDS with plans that not only look towards the short term, but also the medium and long term, with solid financing schemes that include the strengthening of health systems. The Rio Group reaffirms its role as a responsible actor in the fight against HIV/AIDS and calls for the participation of all sectors of society, in particular civil society, as crucial to reaching the goal in the fight against this epidemic. Allow me now to say a few additional words in my national capacity. In the past five years, Mexico has exponentially multiplied its resources in its response to HIV. With regard to the availability of antiretroviral medicines for people without health insurance alone, we have increased our expenditures by 390 per cent. Mexico currently devotes more than $350 million annually to finance its response to HIV. Treatment is completely free of charge. The distribution of free condoms, which are paid for by our national AIDS programme, has grown from 3 million units in 2005 to 30 million currently. We have adopted a constitutional amendment against discrimination, as well as new national and local laws to protect people from HIV and to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 4 Similarly, we have in place no laws or restrictions of any kind preventing people living with HIV from entering our country. Given the foregoing, I should like to conclude by inviting everyone to visit Mexico from 3 to 8 August this year for the seventeenth International AIDS Conference. We have been working to receive visitors and would like to share our experiences. Above all, however, we want to learn from each and every one of you, for we are convinced that only through dialogue and cooperation can we find a comprehensive response to the challenge posed by HIV/AIDS. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.6957626414182414e-08, 'ActionObject': 2.6556437049407577e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 2.154622258387917e-08, 'Body': 1.1861486792774656e-10, 'Clarification': 3.658759695213121e-08, 'Conclusion': 1.8756343145298615e-09, 'Election': 1.6141719072493288e-08, 'General': 0.9999995231628418, 'Introduction': 3.753670085870908e-08, 'MeetingDateTime': 5.549509296542965e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 1.633295809710944e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 1.1024224866318377e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 1.7274484065410434e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 1.562925255882419e-08, 'OralStatement': 5.5646694363531424e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 5.103367950454185e-09, 'RVRequested': 4.082818111372788e-11, 'RVTaken': 5.110651901674146e-10, 'Session': 2.6172208844599254e-09, 'Sponsorship': 3.165092188339713e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.134734249954363e-09, 'Vote': 8.812296670157593e-09, 'VotingIntention': 8.463754852527927e-08}\",\n[[\"C\\u00f3rdoba Villalobos\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Mexico\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"21\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"nearly 2 million\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2001\", \"DATE\"], [\"2001\", \"DATE\"], [\"more than 40\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"3\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"past two\", \"PARA\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"2007\", \"DATE\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"at least 95\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"past five\", \"PARA\"], [\"Mexico\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Mexico\", \"UNPE\"], [\"annually\", \"DATE\"], [\"3 million\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2005\", \"DATE\"], [\"30 million\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"4\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Mexico\", \"UNPE\"], [\"3 to 8 August this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"seventeenth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 67,\n            'f': \"67\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 67,\n            'f': \"67\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999830722808838,\n            'f': \"0.9999830722808838\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The Acting President: I now give the floor to His Excellency The Honourable Brigadier General Brian Chituwo, Minister of Health of the Republic of Zambia.\",\n\"{'Action': 1.041317476691006e-09, 'ActionObject': 2.424060729921962e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 1.268549453925516e-06, 'Body': 5.415716763934597e-10, 'Clarification': 8.465512180144685e-10, 'Conclusion': 1.2589650566496857e-07, 'Election': 1.2223498657704113e-08, 'General': 1.114591123041464e-05, 'Introduction': 0.9999830722808838, 'MeetingDateTime': 7.022799008993275e-11, 'MeetingLocation': 3.6992837681992796e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 2.469684234895908e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 7.136931685636227e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 7.922730027587477e-09, 'OralStatement': 5.921862121765348e-14, 'PresidingOfficer': 4.4115441255598853e-07, 'RVRequested': 2.607505848573055e-06, 'RVTaken': 2.6967961197499335e-10, 'Session': 2.0432533442971135e-10, 'Sponsorship': 1.126601199483157e-12, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 4.990075126443116e-07, 'Vote': 6.86062477939231e-08, 'VotingIntention': 9.463097860873404e-09}\",\n[[\"Brian Chituwo\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the Republic of Zambia\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 68,\n            'f': \"68\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 68,\n            'f': \"68\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999953508377075,\n            'f': \"0.9999953508377075\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Chituwo (Zambia): I am here as an envoy of the current Chairperson of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), His Excellency Mr. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa, to make a statement to this high-level meeting on HIV/AIDS. I regret that he is unable to be here owing to other international engagements. However, it is my pleasure to deliver the following statement. I have the honour to speak on behalf of the member States of the Southern African Development Community \\u2014 namely, Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lesotho, Malawi, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, the United Republic of Tanzania, Zimbabwe and my own country, Zambia. I should like to align my statement with the statement delivered by the representative of Antigua and Barbuda. May I commend the Assembly for convening this very important review meeting to asses the progress made in the implementation of the 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS and the 2006 Political Declaration. I also wish to thank the Secretary-General for his succinct report (A/62/780) and the recommendations contained therein, which merit our careful consideration. I wish to share with the General Assembly the regional status of HIV/AIDS, current interventions and challenges impeding our efforts to intensify our response. The region has 4 per cent of the world\\u2019s population, but accounts for 36 per cent of the world\\u2019s population living with HIV/AIDS, making it the region most affected by the epidemic. Underdevelopment and poverty make many people in the region vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, while the epidemic itself continues to undermine ongoing developmental efforts. SADC heads of State and Government have made several commitments to reverse the epidemic and reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS, as reflected in the following documents: the 2001 Abuja Declaration, the 2001 Declaration of Commitment of the special session of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS, the 2003 Maseru Declaration on HIV/AIDS and the 2006 Brazzaville Declaration on Universal Access. SADC\\u2019s Maseru Declaration on HIV/AIDS articulated five priority intervention areas that guide the multisectoral response to HIV/AIDS in the region. Those are prevention and social mobilization; improving care, access, counselling and testing services, treatment and support; accelerating development and mitigating the impact of HIV/AIDS; intensifying resource mobilization and strengthening institutional monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. As a result of those commitments, significant progress has been made in implementing those five priority areas. Member States have heightened prevention interventions in order to reduce new HIV infections. Efforts have also been scaled up to provide comprehensive treatment, care and support services, including treatment for opportunistic infections and antiretroviral therapy. Given the high number of orphaned and vulnerable children, we are developing a comprehensive regional programme to complement impact mitigation efforts carried out by member States. At both the regional and country levels, more and more resources are being mobilized to support the response to HIV/AIDS. In 2007, SADC established a regional fund to which member States contribute every year. The response to HIV/AIDS in the region has also benefited from generous contributions by international cooperating partners and donors. Efforts are continuing to improve surveillance, monitoring and research capacities in the region. Despite our commitments to make a difference in the lives of our people, we are faced with a number of challenges \\u2014 such as overburdened health care systems, especially in terms of infrastructure and human resource capacities; underdevelopment and 5 poverty, especially now in the context of the rising costs of food and oil as well as the effects of climate change; inadequate monitoring and evaluation systems, as well as research capacity and ownership; limited alignment and harmonization of AIDS resources in line with the Paris and Rome Declarations; and unaffordable prices of medicines, especially antiretroviral drugs. Aware of the challenges to which I have referred, member States of SADC have resolved to jointly mobilize our capacities and resources to fight the epidemic. This devastating challenge goes beyond our cultural, religious, national, continental and global boundaries. There is therefore a need for all of us to collaborate and cooperate, and even make personal commitments, in order to win the war against HIV/AIDS. As a region, we need to further explore the potential of the existing partnership arrangements with the various development and financing institutions. We need technical and financial support as we strive to meet the commitments we made to reaching universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and support. In conclusion, on behalf of SADC member States, I wish to take this opportunity to extend our sincere appreciation to all our development partners for providing technical and financial support. It is our hope that we will continue to work together as partners for mutual benefit in addressing this millennial challenge. I shall now make a statement in my national capacity. As an envoy of His Excellency Mr. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa, President of the Republic of Zambia, it is my pleasure and privilege to report on the HIV/AIDS situation in Zambia and to update the General Assembly on the progress made thus far in the fight against the pandemic following the commitments we made in 2001. However, I regret to inform the Assembly that AIDS remains the most serious threat to the socio-economic development of Zambia. We have been living with this crisis for over two decades now, with more than 50 per cent of the Zambian population born in the era of HIV/AIDS. As a country, we recognize that most of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) may not be achieved unless we continue to scale up the response to HIV/AIDS. 6 We have initiated a multisectoral response and have invited partners to join us. In addition, we have taken a series of bold steps that include, among others, the introduction, in 1999, of a programme to prevent mother-to-child transmission. We are at the forefront in rolling out preventive services to protect unborn babies. Currently, nearly 40 per cent of pregnant mothers in Zambia are accessing services to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Moreover, in 2002 we introduced antiretrovirals in the public sector, using our own resources, despite the huge cost it entailed. By 2005 we had secured enough support for the antiretroviral therapy programme to sustain the provision of antiretrovirals. Today, we are proud that over 50 per cent of our citizens requiring treatment are accessing antiretrovirals free of charge. We are now on our way to achieving universal access to treatment, with a projected survival rate of nearly 90 per cent. The Declaration of Commitment calls for universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support, which implies that the responsibility to mitigate HIV/AIDS goes beyond the scope of the health sector and Government. Consequently, as part of the multisectoral response, the Government acknowledges the critical role played by civil society and the private sector, and appreciates the innovations of those stakeholders in scaling up the antiretroviral therapy programme. An illustration of our commitment to the multisectoral response is the clear role assigned to the National AIDS Council, whose main focus is coordination. I am happy to report that, since the last special session of the General Assembly, the National AIDS Council has coordinated the development of a national strategic framework on HIV/AIDS and has mainstreamed HIV into our fifth national development plan. The National AIDS Council has also set up coordination structures at all levels to facilitate a decentralized response in our country. As a nation, we realize that HIV/AIDS cannot be fought without addressing the issues of poverty at the community level. We have therefore endeavoured to engage the community in both prevention and impact-mitigation efforts. Our multisectoral response also encompasses the education sector, where we are experiencing even higher enrolment figures for orphans and vulnerable children following the introduction of free education. That is heartening, as it means that we are not losing the next generation to ignorance. Similarly, in the area of agriculture and fisheries, we have begun to register success in providing mobile HIV testing to communities. It is clear that encouraging progress has been made at the national level; however, the road ahead requires much greater effort by all players, including the Government, the international community and civil society, if we are to achieve the goals we set ourselves for 2010 and 2015. We are confident that the outcome of this meeting will identify critical elements necessary to significantly scale up efforts in the areas of prevention, treatment, care and support. Of particular interest among those are the following elements: increasing young people\\u2019s knowledge about transmission; addressing the issue of children with HIV and the brain drain in the health sector; strengthening health systems; mobilizing resources; empowering women and intensifying research. Let me take this opportunity to assure the Assembly that AIDS is at the core of our development agenda. Having mainstreamed HIV/AIDS into all sectors, there is a need to sustain and expand collective efforts over the next generation. I will continue to provide the leadership necessary to harmonize the response and to make sure that assistance is efficiently and effectively utilized in order to halt and reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS in my country. \",\n\"{'Action': 2.0642501397105661e-07, 'ActionObject': 5.686968052032171e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 5.488611236614815e-07, 'Body': 3.1509543862995315e-09, 'Clarification': 3.516048820983997e-07, 'Conclusion': 3.491777178510347e-08, 'Election': 1.6927171486713632e-07, 'General': 0.9999953508377075, 'Introduction': 9.8779457857745e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 3.804658987860421e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 1.5570653033591952e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 1.942377281238805e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 5.219777108322887e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 1.708075672013365e-07, 'OralStatement': 4.2901314145638025e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 9.532510603094124e-08, 'RVRequested': 1.674311578270249e-09, 'RVTaken': 8.539278617547552e-09, 'Session': 2.5725301000534273e-08, 'Sponsorship': 2.0417806112504877e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 7.646275435035932e-08, 'Vote': 4.6434980305321005e-08, 'VotingIntention': 7.377130941677024e-07}\",\n[[\"Chituwo\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Zambia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Chairperson\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Levy Patrick Mwanawasa\", \"PERSON\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Angola\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Botswana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the Democratic Republic of the Congo\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Lesotho\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Malawi\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Madagascar\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Mauritius\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Mozambique\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Namibia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"South Africa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the United Republic of Tanzania\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Zimbabwe\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Zambia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Antigua and Barbuda\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2001\", \"DATE\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"A/62/780\", \"Symbol\"], [\"2001\", \"DATE\"], [\"Abuja Declaration\", \"PERSON\"], [\"2001\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"five\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"five\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2007\", \"DATE\"], [\"every year\", \"DATE\"], [\"5\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Levy Patrick Mwanawasa\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the Republic of Zambia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Zambia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2001\", \"DATE\"], [\"Zambia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"over two decades\", \"DATE\"], [\"more than 50\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"6\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"1999\", \"DATE\"], [\"Zambia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2002\", \"DATE\"], [\"2005\", \"DATE\"], [\"Today\", \"DATE\"], [\"fifth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"2015\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 69,\n            'f': \"69\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 69,\n            'f': \"69\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9998766183853149,\n            'f': \"0.9998766183853149\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The Acting President: I now give the floor to Her Excellency Ms. Amenta Matthew, Minister of Health of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\",\n\"{'Action': 1.3735430848260677e-10, 'ActionObject': 9.190855715379698e-11, 'AgendaStatus': 2.066670248268565e-07, 'Body': 3.2636580937772663e-11, 'Clarification': 4.208340065314786e-10, 'Conclusion': 1.916118286260371e-08, 'Election': 5.46970291281923e-09, 'General': 0.00012176860036561266, 'Introduction': 0.9998766183853149, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.0337164457752124e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 2.985203195748909e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 8.322879607725042e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 3.9633999193711134e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 2.8337987512117024e-09, 'OralStatement': 2.435636040049689e-15, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.0249970589247823e-07, 'RVRequested': 2.607706903745566e-07, 'RVTaken': 2.14888003224889e-11, 'Session': 4.605156533887822e-11, 'Sponsorship': 4.1197644254364896e-13, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.577774781935659e-07, 'Vote': 7.326897843995539e-07, 'VotingIntention': 6.6697785072733495e-09}\",\n[[\"Amenta Matthew\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the Republic of the Marshall Islands\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 70,\n            'f': \"70\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 70,\n            'f': \"70\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999672174453735,\n            'f': \"0.9999672174453735\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Matthew (Marshall Islands): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Pacific small island developing States, namely, Fiji, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, the Kingdom of Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and my own country, the Republic of the Marshall Islands. I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the President for his strong leadership in convening this high-level global leaders\\u2019 forum on HIV/AIDS. This forum provides an opportunity for all State and non-State actors to undertake a comprehensive review of the progress made in realizing the 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS and the 2006 Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS and, more importantly, it is an opportune time to further engage leaders in a comprehensive global response to the epidemic. We welcome the recent decline in HIV infection in Africa, especially in certain sub-Saharan African countries. But we realize that great challenges remain, including in Southern Africa. We recognize that the tragic and grave impact of HIV/AIDS in Africa is far more than an isolated or purely regional concern. We encourage all Member States to address this most important shared responsibility. Although the prevalence of HIV remains low in most of our countries, HIV/AIDS continues to be a major concern for all the small island States of the Pacific region. Our countries are at high risk because of the high proportion of young people among our populations, our fast rate of social change and the high mobility of our populations. The first case of infection was reported in 1984. Today, reported rates of infection are rising quickly in several Pacific island countries. Tuberculosis is a problem in the Pacific region, and HIV/AIDS is especially deadly for tuberculosis- infected persons. Tuberculosis infection rates in several of our nations are among the highest in the world. We strongly urge the global community to strengthen its approach to co-infection with HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. We note in particular the importance of strengthening our diagnostic laboratory and health-care capacities, especially in remote rural areas. The unique and remote geographies of Pacific small island developing States provide barriers to the delivery of preventative health care. The Secretariat of the Pacific Community has identified 11 key factors in the transmission of HIV/AIDS. One of the major difficulties in our region relates to sustaining comprehensive national responses given the lack of resources; resistance in communities to addressing the stigma attached to HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections; the lack of capacity to provide adequate treatment and health care for people living with HIV; the lack of consistency in coordination between national and regional governments and the need to strengthen gender equality. Governments in our region are committed to addressing the key causes of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Our efforts have been consistent, and we continue to work together as a region to halt the spread of HIV/AIDS. In the mid-1990s, through the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, the countries of the Pacific region adopted a regional strategy to address the issue of HIV/AIDS. Subsequently, the current Pacific 7 regional strategy on HIV/AIDS for the period 2004-2008 was adopted. The strategy is framed in line with 11 principles that acknowledge the traditional, cultural and religious values of Pacific communities. It affirms the protection of human rights, the building of partnerships and the protection of vulnerable groups and people living with HIV/AIDS in the Pacific region. We have made progress in combating the spread of HIV/AIDS in our region. For example, our national and joint regional initiatives are listed in our written statement. In 2007, the Pacific Forum secretariat issued a communiqu\\u00e9 that outlined the commitments made by the leaders and Government officials of our region. Those included the extension for five more years of the Pacific regional strategy on HIV/AIDS for the period 2004 to 2008, to cover the period 2009 to 2013. Stronger emphasis will be placed on taking preventative measures with regard to HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. The ministers of health of the region have committed themselves to develop a health framework that includes the priorities and the phase-two implementation of the priorities outlined by the strategy. The negative impact of climate change is likely to heighten the vulnerability of our region and make us more susceptible to the spread of the epidemic. Climate change will not directly cause the spread of the epidemic, but it will significantly weaken our infrastructure, deplete our limited resources and over- stretch our already challenged health-care system. The increase in temperature and natural disasters threatens us not only with population displacement and death, but also food insecurity in our region. The lack of access to nutritious food will result in the weakening of our people\\u2019s immune systems. Population dislocation also has the potential for the spread of infectious diseases, affecting in particular the most vulnerable groups, such as women and children. To prevent such tragedies from happening, we urge the international community to continue its commitment to combating the HIV/AIDS epidemic by better addressing those cross-cutting issues and by incorporating preventative health measures into our global development and climate strategies. I should now like to speak in my national capacity. The Republic of the Marshall Islands is no stranger to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. For a country of 53,000 persons with a remote geography and limited medical capacity in our rural outer islands, even a case or two of HIV/AIDS poses a formidable challenge as regards containment and preventing further spread. Since we started to document and report cases, in the late 1980s, there have been 12 reported cases of HIV infection and two reported cases of AIDS, respectively. Given the size of our population, coupled with our limited capabilities and resources, the number should be significantly higher. The risk to our remote developing island nation is far greater than what the data show. The rate of global funding has accelerated since the 2001 special session. We urge the international community to fulfil existing commitments and to provide funding for research and development. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has estimated that $11.4 billion will be needed to reverse the epidemic by 2015. We would like to commend the secretariat of UNAIDS and its co-sponsors for their leadership role regarding HIV/AIDS policy and coordination, as well as for the support provided to countries through the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. We would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude for the generous assistance from key international partners, including UNAIDS, the World Health Organization, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United Nations Population Fund, UNICEF, the United Nations Department of Political Affairs, the National Union of Organizations of People Living with HIV and AIDS, the United States Health Resources and Services Administration and the Ryan White Foundation, the Australian Government Overseas Aid Program, the International Federation of the Red Cross, the Pacific Island Forum secretariat and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, for their efforts in combating HIV/AIDS in our region.

My delegation would like to associate itself with the statements delivered by the representative of Antigua and Barbuda, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and the representative of Mexico, on behalf of the Rio Group. Ecuador welcomes the General Assembly\\u2019s decision to convene a high-level meeting to carry out a comprehensive review of the progress achieved in implementing the 2001 Declaration of Commitment and the 2006 Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS. Two years before the deadline set by the international community to achieve universal access to prevention, treatment, care and support in the fight against HIV/AIDS and halfway to the target date set for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), this is a unique opportunity to assess how far we have gone towards achieving one of the most important of the Goals, namely, eradicating this global pandemic disease. My delegation would also like to express its gratitude for the report (A/62/780) of the Secretary- General before the Assembly. We agree with his assessment that there has been progress in responding to HIV in many regions of the world since 2006 as a result of the political commitment of many countries, such as Ecuador, to carry out sustained policies in the areas of public investment aimed at eradicating HIV. However, as the Secretary-General himself has stated, that progress has been uneven and the pandemic has spread at a rate greater than the efforts made by States. Ecuador believes that the spread of the disease cannot be brought under control unless we succeed in achieving the much-desired sustainability in policies to prevent and respond to the disease. Those policies must no longer be focused on emergency measures; rather, they should be transformed into long-term programmes that are sufficiently funded. However, achieving long- term sustainability requires that we address other factors. Those factors include eradicating poverty, reducing child mortality and achieving gender equality \\u2014 all of which are Millennium Development Goals that are directly linked to the global fight against Political commitment and leadership \\u2014 as well as participation by all social sectors, including civil society and people living with HIV \\u2014 continue to be fundamental pillars in making further progress towards achieving universal access to prevention, treatment, care and support services. Ecuador believes that, given the high and ever- growing number of young people living with HIV/AIDS, programmes on sexual education and the scope of the disease must be strengthened at all levels as some of the most important preventive measures. With regard to responding to AIDS, Ecuador has made substantive progress in halting the spread of the pandemic. The Government of the citizen revolution has given priority to preventing AIDS and providing care as part of its national development plan. There are currently 12,740 cases of people who have lived with HIV/AIDS since 1984. Treatment, which is provided by the Ministry of Public Health through the public health network, covers 80 per cent of people living with HIV/AIDS. Ecuador relies on complementary funds from the World Bank to meet the current demand for antiretroviral treatment. We have strengthened and established new treatment centres \\u2014 known as AIDS clinics \\u2014 in both our national specialized hospitals and those in provinces where demand is highest. At the end of 2007 our country had 6 clinics throughout the country. We now have 22 clinics providing specialized treatment \\u2014 10 of which provide comprehensive treatment to people living with AIDS, nine provide services to prevent the vertical transmission of HIV and eight provide both services. Preliminary data from an initial sampling reveals that the prevalence of HIV among gay men, transgender persons and men who have sex with men was 19.3 per cent. That indicates that the epidemic is concentrated in those most exposed groups. The rate of infection among female sex workers was 3.76 per cent. The Ministry of Public Health is implementing a comprehensive care model that includes family care and community participation and efforts to combat stigmatization and discrimination in accessing health services, for our mission is to provide health care for human beings. In 2006, 48.9 per cent of HIV-infected pregnant women were receiving antiretroviral treatment to prevent the transmission of HIV; in 2007, that 9 percentage increased to 74.1 per cent. The high rate of coverage in prophylactic treatment achieved in 2007 was due to the encouraging results of a public policy that made it a priority to achieve the country\\u2019s goal of no more children with HIV by 2015. Ecuador\\u2019s constitution and local laws prohibit discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS or having different sexual orientation, as well as on the basis of health status. Moreover, in the area of employment, a ministerial decree prohibits mandatory HIV testing as a precondition for employment. Draft legislation is currently pending on preventing all forms of discrimination, including for persons living with HIV/AIDS. In addition, the Government, the Office of the Vice-President, the various ministries with responsibilities in the social sector and civil society are all actively engaged in the fight against AIDS. In 2004 10.4 per cent of women surveyed indicated that they had had their first sexual experience before the age of 15; in 2007 that age rose to 19. That points to a generational trend indicating a rise in the age of first sexual encounter, which could lead us to conclude that there is a greater impact to the efforts made in the areas of sexual education, reducing early pregnancy among adolescents and the scope of the disease. There has been a clear increase in social investment in my country in the past two years to control HIV/AIDS. In that connection, the budget for prevention, which was barely $600,000 in 2005, rose by almost $3 million in 2006. The budget for care and treatment in 2006 was almost $4 million, as compared to $1.7 million in 2005. We should not lose hope in the fight to eradicate this serious pandemic. Most of our countries have made important progress in responding to HIV/AIDS, especially as regards antiretroviral treatment, preventing mother-to-child transmission and in confidential and voluntary medical testing. However, there has been less progress as regards efforts aimed at prevention and universal access to treatment, especially for orphans, women and children living in poverty in many countries. It is crucial to reduce the gaps in access to prevention for the most exposed groups \\u2014 such as female sex workers, men who have sex with men, intravenous drug users, persons deprived of their freedom and the poorest and most marginalized members of the population. 10 Similarly, if we want to meet the commitments we have entered into by 2010, we must redouble efforts at achieving universal access. To that end, we need clearer political direction and stronger leadership that will lead to a comprehensive, multisectoral and decentralized response to this scourge on humankind. That response must also be underpinned by the basic assumption that there is a need for rich and poor countries alike to honour the commitments they have assumed, especially those related to eradicating poverty and underdevelopment. As it has until now, Ecuador will continue to engage with the international community in the ongoing efforts to ensure the survival of human beings and our peoples. \",\n\"{'Action': 4.4623657657894e-08, 'ActionObject': 8.232218462467245e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 4.534643238685021e-08, 'Body': 4.1597270072912806e-10, 'Clarification': 6.922766715433681e-08, 'Conclusion': 3.2099842783850363e-09, 'Election': 4.709315248874191e-08, 'General': 0.9999994039535522, 'Introduction': 1.3464527626183553e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.5909689565773988e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 4.026200883799902e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 3.652266045151009e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 7.05182401361526e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 3.4236858681424565e-08, 'OralStatement': 7.65843566341573e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.2848596853132221e-08, 'RVRequested': 1.309045927211372e-10, 'RVTaken': 1.2047088882027879e-09, 'Session': 5.504316558102573e-09, 'Sponsorship': 6.845477962258428e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.2258697168476829e-08, 'Vote': 2.2336898553021456e-08, 'VotingIntention': 1.6914766831632733e-07}\",\n[[\"Chang\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Ecuador\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Antigua and Barbuda\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Mexico\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Ecuador\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2001\", \"DATE\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"Two years\", \"DATE\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"A/62/780\", \"Symbol\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"Ecuador\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Ecuador\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Ecuador\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Ecuador\", \"UNPE\"], [\"12,740\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"1984\", \"DATE\"], [\"Ecuador\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the end of 2007\", \"DATE\"], [\"6\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"22\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"10\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"nine\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"eight\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"2007\", \"DATE\"], [\"9\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2007\", \"DATE\"], [\"2015\", \"DATE\"], [\"Ecuador\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2004\", \"DATE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"the age of 15\", \"DATE\"], [\"2007\", \"DATE\"], [\"rose\", \"MS\"], [\"19\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the age of first sexual encounter\", \"DATE\"], [\"past two\", \"PARA\"], [\"2005\", \"DATE\"], [\"rose\", \"MS\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"2005\", \"DATE\"], [\"10\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"Ecuador\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 74,\n            'f': \"74\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 74,\n            'f': \"74\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999803304672241,\n            'f': \"0.9999803304672241\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The Acting President: I now give the floor to His Excellency The Honourable Daniel Kwelagobe, Minister for Presidential Affairs and Public Administration of Botswana.\",\n\"{'Action': 4.788354712736975e-10, 'ActionObject': 8.815014829188783e-10, 'AgendaStatus': 1.7271162278120755e-07, 'Body': 4.0330760953111167e-10, 'Clarification': 2.9246688404427346e-10, 'Conclusion': 7.99916577420845e-08, 'Election': 4.981870915798936e-08, 'General': 1.4835508409305476e-05, 'Introduction': 0.9999803304672241, 'MeetingDateTime': 8.905965548366979e-11, 'MeetingLocation': 2.6206974368392366e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 2.481060912273847e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 6.531484473271121e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 3.297269790536461e-09, 'OralStatement': 5.495435835854495e-15, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.582543944778081e-07, 'RVRequested': 2.603959956104518e-06, 'RVTaken': 1.6530919688673151e-10, 'Session': 7.038284954852259e-10, 'Sponsorship': 3.5984637578728718e-12, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.8254199574130325e-07, 'Vote': 9.84787675406551e-07, 'VotingIntention': 3.801168713124525e-09}\",\n[[\"Daniel Kwelagobe\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Botswana\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 75,\n            'f': \"75\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 75,\n            'f': \"75\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 1.0,\n            'f': \"1.0\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Kwelagobe (Botswana): It is indeed an honour and a privilege to address the General Assembly today on the progress that we have made, individually and collectively, as members of the global village, as we agreed here in 2006 and in 2001. My delegation aligns itself with the statements made by the representative of Antigua and Barbuda on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and by the representative of Zambia on behalf of the Southern African Development Community. At the 2006 high-level meeting on HIV/AIDS, we committed ourselves to a set of ambitious national targets aimed at scaling up towards universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support by 2010. The implementation of this commitment is a key milestone for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal 6 in particular, a Goal aiming to halt and reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015. This meeting is therefore a critical opportunity to share achievements and challenges, but, more important, also to exchange experiences and best practices that will guide us all along a sustainable path into a future free of HIV/AIDS. In the past we have continued to experience a growing number of new infections, moving us further away from achieving our goal. As we welcome with appreciation the report of the Secretary-General (A/62/780), we are encouraged that there are indications of progress around the globe, even though they are not uniform across and within countries. We note, for example, that the annual rate of new HIV infections has declined over the last decade. While, to be sure, we must appreciate these achievements, we remain concerned that the current efforts are still not enough to enable us to achieve our set goals. The rate of progress in expanding universal access to the required services still cannot keep pace with the growth of the epidemic. It is therefore imperative that we accelerate the rate of the provision of services to combat HIV/AIDS in all aspects. We in sub-Saharan Africa are particularly concerned by that continued threat. Our region, which is where more than two thirds of all people infected with HIV live, remains the most affected. It is encouraging that we have begun to experience a decline in prevalence in some countries of the region. We are confident that, with the unwavering support of the international community, we as a region will consolidate this achievement. In recognizing the development effects of the epidemic, for more than two decades Botswana has mobilized and mounted an aggressive national response, which was led by the former President, His Excellency Festus Mogae, who during his tenure also chaired the National AIDS Council. I am happy to report that the former President continues to chair that Council, which is a clear indication of the current presidency\\u2019s commitment to consolidate, and indeed to further, the political leadership needed to drive that development agenda. Botswana is one of the countries that has made significant progress in combating the epidemic. Through our programme for the prevention of mother- to-child transmission, we are now able to deliver 96 HIV-free newborn babies out of every 100, compared to the average of 60 in 1999. This has the potential to significantly reduce infant mortality, among other things. In 2002, we introduced a national treatment programme, offering free treatment to citizens who meet the criteria. It currently enrols over 88 per cent of those in need of treatment. More important, we are experiencing less than 10 per cent mortality among those receiving treatment. Our experience is that accessible, affordable and effective treatment creates a more favourable environment for HIV prevention. On the other hand, treatment success can also give a false sense of security. That is a challenge that, if ignored, will reverse the gains made so far. For these programmes to be accessible, it is important that everybody knows their HIV status. Otherwise, the attainment of the set targets is at risk. To that end, in 2004 Botswana introduced routine HIV testing in all its facilities, which has had a telling impact. Since 2006, we have been experiencing a declining trend in prevalence among those who have been tested for the first time. Generally, there is strong evidence that is suggestive of a levelling off of, if not a decline in, the epidemic, which can only be due to reduced incidence, given the high survival rates, in particular, among those on treatment. In order to reinforce that trend, Botswana has now embarked on a more aggressive effort towards scaling up prevention, which we consider the mainstay of our national response. Despite those achievements, we continue to be inundated with challenges. The high disease burden has directly affected our human resource capacities, which are pivotal in this fight. Allow me to conclude by acknowledging and thanking all our partners for their various forms of invaluable support in saving many lives. \",\n\"{'Action': 5.6744760001947725e-09, 'ActionObject': 9.192572814065159e-10, 'AgendaStatus': 6.225729709541383e-09, 'Body': 1.821098133403254e-11, 'Clarification': 1.5894745075684114e-08, 'Conclusion': 5.165435301712762e-10, 'Election': 4.491090166425238e-09, 'General': 1.0, 'Introduction': 3.5546577237255406e-08, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.3203452492737142e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 4.712199963563535e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 2.4194860004378427e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 1.6171516348251203e-09, 'MeetingStatus': 6.235866933934631e-09, 'OralStatement': 4.337175507629354e-09, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.4768588008660117e-09, 'RVRequested': 1.274001650702905e-11, 'RVTaken': 8.56591533815454e-11, 'Session': 4.5955125815844156e-10, 'Sponsorship': 5.133298786041962e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 9.856981897371497e-10, 'Vote': 6.704646171584727e-09, 'VotingIntention': 2.956784506125132e-08}\",\n[[\"Kwelagobe\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Botswana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"2001\", \"DATE\"], [\"Antigua and Barbuda\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Zambia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"2015\", \"DATE\"], [\"report of the Secretary-General (A/62/780)\", \"RPT\"], [\"annual\", \"DATE\"], [\"the last decade\", \"DATE\"], [\"more than two thirds\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"more than two decades\", \"DATE\"], [\"Botswana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Botswana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"96\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"100\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"60\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"1999\", \"DATE\"], [\"2002\", \"DATE\"], [\"2004\", \"DATE\"], [\"Botswana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Botswana\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 76,\n            'f': \"76\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 76,\n            'f': \"76\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999746084213257,\n            'f': \"0.9999746084213257\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The Acting President: I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Amar Tou, Minister of Health, Population and Hospital Reform of Algeria.\",\n\"{'Action': 6.163624721722272e-09, 'ActionObject': 8.509688953495242e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 6.806290571148566e-07, 'Body': 1.7774819394134056e-09, 'Clarification': 2.807235777169126e-09, 'Conclusion': 1.24283431546246e-07, 'Election': 1.716673949658798e-07, 'General': 1.1336864190525375e-05, 'Introduction': 0.9999746084213257, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.0918901338641263e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 1.0210535528187847e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 7.837758886353186e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 3.44220808301543e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 2.5728494890131515e-08, 'OralStatement': 4.0236172412552035e-14, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.797046820684045e-06, 'RVRequested': 6.093174306442961e-06, 'RVTaken': 5.486997523007631e-10, 'Session': 2.1618127288292044e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.5778147885447957e-11, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.5600049891872914e-06, 'Vote': 3.2582668154645944e-06, 'VotingIntention': 1.6769847732689414e-08}\",\n[[\"Amar Tou\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Algeria\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 77,\n            'f': \"77\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 77,\n            'f': \"77\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.999998927116394,\n            'f': \"0.999998927116394\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Tou (Algeria) (spoke in Arabic): My delegation is honoured to support the statement delivered by the representative of Antigua and Barbuda on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and by the representative of Egypt on behalf of the African Group. My delegation would also like to thank Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon for his report (A/62/780), which provides a comprehensive assessment of the progress made in implementing the 2001 Declaration of Commitment and the 2006 Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS. The report also gives an overview of the difficulties that continue to hamper our collective action against that scourge. Turning to the item that has brought us together today, its breadth and scope are heartrending for all of us. The report of the Secretary-General has clearly shown that global HIV prevalence has stabilized and that the number of new infections has fallen. At the 11 same time, however, that praiseworthy progress is still uneven, because some regions and countries, in particular those in Africa, remain heavily affected by this scourge. Obviously, that situation is closely linked to poverty, conflict and the overall underdevelopment of that region. Although the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate in Algeria is only 0.14 per cent, my country\\u2019s commitment to fight against the pandemic remains full and unwavering, as has been confirmed by the relevant United Nations agencies. Algeria\\u2019s accession to all international commitments in the fight against HIV/AIDS demonstrates its willingness to deeply commit to the global response to this scourge. That commitment is reflected at the national level in the adoption and implementation of a comprehensive policy based on a broad health-care network with universal access to prevention, treatment, care, and psychosocial and social support, and based also on combating stigmatization and discrimination. In addition, the fact that my country was the first in the Arab and Islamic world to see the creation of an association of people living with HIV clearly reflects the Algerian Government\\u2019s strategic partnership with civil society in the fight against this pandemic. Algeria\\u2019s national policy is embodied in a special organizational structure to fight this disease. It involves a network of 60 voluntary and free HIV screening centres, 12 treatment and care centres and a national reference laboratory for confirmation, which will be decentralized in the near future through the ongoing establishment of some 20 annexes. This network covers the entire territory of our country and is aimed particularly at facilitating access for everyone without exception. Furthermore, and thanks to the strong will and commitment of Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, President of the Republic, important financial and human resources have been mobilized to put in place all necessary structures and to ensure diagnosis and free access to treatment and antiretroviral and hepatitis drugs. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria have been of great help and we pay a warm tribute to them. Their ongoing support has helped and, without any doubt, will ensure the increasing effectiveness of our actions. On the basis of our experience, we in Algeria reaffirm our commitment to pursue our efforts and our entire readiness to contribute to the praiseworthy efforts of the United Nations, and in particular to attain the health-related Millennium Development Goals. \",\n\"{'Action': 7.012811664708352e-09, 'ActionObject': 2.653981256983684e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 4.791126073655505e-08, 'Body': 2.0142372492149008e-10, 'Clarification': 1.6954901482790774e-08, 'Conclusion': 5.545834458331456e-09, 'Election': 3.639033252511581e-08, 'General': 0.999998927116394, 'Introduction': 6.484461891886895e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.5778872370096906e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 1.5882394066579764e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 2.57021826044479e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 1.9513028348683292e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 9.482291396523124e-09, 'OralStatement': 6.242870664863176e-09, 'PresidingOfficer': 6.745647596062554e-09, 'RVRequested': 3.4634037304748233e-10, 'RVTaken': 6.14728767889261e-10, 'Session': 3.321924735288917e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.5611208992183379e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 5.026458360646302e-09, 'Vote': 1.807009830656625e-08, 'VotingIntention': 6.580131639566389e-08}\",\n[[\"Tou\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Algeria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Antigua and Barbuda\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Egypt\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Ban Ki-moon\", \"PERSON\"], [\"A/62/780\", \"Symbol\"], [\"2001\", \"DATE\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"11\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Algeria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Algeria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Algeria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"60\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"12\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"some 20\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Abdelaziz Bouteflika\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Algeria\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 78,\n            'f': \"78\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 78,\n            'f': \"78\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999980926513672,\n            'f': \"0.9999980926513672\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The Acting President: I now give the floor to Her Excellency Ms. Ulla Schmidt, Federal Minister for Health of Germany.\",\n\"{'Action': 2.8142686098187042e-11, 'ActionObject': 1.14331866196693e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 1.7745378499967046e-07, 'Body': 1.8151785630138306e-11, 'Clarification': 1.954264944314943e-10, 'Conclusion': 1.00722399309916e-08, 'Election': 1.6899627530708727e-10, 'General': 1.2037685337418225e-06, 'Introduction': 0.9999980926513672, 'MeetingDateTime': 6.154256791679469e-12, 'MeetingLocation': 1.1819667466994588e-10, 'MeetingNumber': 8.494668857217391e-11, 'MeetingSegment': 3.194862596700432e-09, 'MeetingStatus': 4.869119551997869e-10, 'OralStatement': 1.2663893244401294e-15, 'PresidingOfficer': 6.590526169247823e-08, 'RVRequested': 3.155386707476282e-07, 'RVTaken': 5.303307706178151e-12, 'Session': 2.1437970756238434e-12, 'Sponsorship': 2.575641861791468e-14, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 6.335907443144606e-08, 'Vote': 2.5997541897027077e-09, 'VotingIntention': 5.254841006774313e-10}\",\n[[\"Ulla Schmidt\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Germany\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 79,\n            'f': \"79\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 79,\n            'f': \"79\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999979734420776,\n            'f': \"0.9999979734420776\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Schmidt (Germany): I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his excellent report (A/62/780). It certainly shows that progress has been made in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Yet I am deeply concerned about some of its main messages. Obviously, we will not achieve the Millennium Development Goal of ensuring access to HIV/AIDS treatment for all people worldwide by 2010. This situation is not acceptable not only from a German point of view, but it is also a common position of the European Union. That is why Germany brought up this topic at the Group of Eight (G-8) summit last year. As a result, the G-8 pledged $60 billion to the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Germany will contribute \\u20ac4 billion by 2015 and as part of this contribution will double its financial support of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to \\u20ac600 million until Affordable drugs are essential to fight against HIV/AIDS. Yet, as already mentioned by many representatives, we have to be very aware of the fact that affordable drugs are only one element of an efficient strategy. Without massive improvements in on-site health-care delivery, the whole debate remains fruitless. In this process, political leadership is vital. It has to be unambiguously assumed by heads of State or Government in order to build up infrastructure and to overcome discrimination and stigmatization, including discrimination in the form of HIV-specific travel restrictions. Of course, another principal obstacle that remains is drug pricing. Drug prices are still too high and threaten to overwhelm local health-care systems. 12 Aware of these challenges, we launched, during Germany\\u2019s European Council presidency, an initiative that might represent a new path for certain countries. All European member States as well as the most important non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are fully behind this initiative and have consented to the Bremen Declaration. High-burden Eastern European and neighbouring States to which the Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights does not apply are supported in firmly establishing comprehensive national AIDS policies. Their experience too is that the pricing of antiretroviral drugs is one of the most urgent problems. We involved the pharmaceutical industry in this process right from the start, and we made sure that there is a strong and lasting commitment by each country to build up an HIV strategy. The components of such a strategy are: education, particularly for young people and women, promoting sexual and reproductive health and rights; prevention, including promotion of safer sex, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, drug substitution, needle exchange, and targeted interventions aimed at other vulnerable groups; free and anonymous access to HIV testing and counselling; universal access to treatment and care; and surveillance, quality assurance and research. I am deeply convinced that this can succeed only if the State and civil society join their efforts in a spirit of cooperation. I am very happy that our partners in and outside the European Union have responded actively to this initiative. One country after another has started to identify the fields of action that need to be combined in an overall programme. In this process, non-governmental organizations, the European Commission, the World Health Organization and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS were, of course, actively involved. We have already made this idea a reality to a certain extent. Country-specific negotiations succeeded in putting the necessary infrastructure in place for a sustainable HIV/AIDS policy. The pharmaceutical industry has contributed by granting perceptible price reductions for antiretrovirals and by supporting the expansion of prevention efforts. I hope and wish that this has created an exemplary model and that the path we have embarked upon may take us nearer to our common goal. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.162188638659245e-07, 'ActionObject': 9.788752031170134e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 3.7919923556728463e-07, 'Body': 1.2515746217189871e-09, 'Clarification': 1.0571639563750068e-07, 'Conclusion': 1.254486292623369e-08, 'Election': 3.087431252879469e-07, 'General': 0.9999979734420776, 'Introduction': 2.8780934258065827e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.3723651548502858e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 9.111845145071129e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 1.3659773756558025e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 2.8082121161787654e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 1.312564990030296e-07, 'OralStatement': 1.430742599950463e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 4.50987265310232e-08, 'RVRequested': 8.844980858846441e-10, 'RVTaken': 4.2766901131585655e-09, 'Session': 3.9571652621361864e-08, 'Sponsorship': 3.635878265129122e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.1497527374615402e-08, 'Vote': 4.3306133790110835e-08, 'VotingIntention': 1.583210433864224e-07}\",\n[[\"Schmidt\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Germany\", \"UNPE\"], [\"A/62/780\", \"Symbol\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"the European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Germany\", \"UNPE\"], [\"last year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Germany\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2015\", \"DATE\"], [\"only one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"12\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Germany\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"One\", \"CARDINAL\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 80,\n            'f': \"80\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 80,\n            'f': \"80\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9991699457168579,\n            'f': \"0.9991699457168579\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The Acting President: I now give the floor to Her Excellency Sheikha Ghalia Bint Mohammad Bin Hamad Al-Thani, Minister and President of the National Health Authority of Qatar.\",\n\"{'Action': 5.706584147446847e-07, 'ActionObject': 1.680045258467544e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 3.9732709410600364e-05, 'Body': 1.4337261688979197e-07, 'Clarification': 4.9573483096310156e-08, 'Conclusion': 3.5874479635822354e-06, 'Election': 1.91327362699667e-05, 'General': 0.0005463683046400547, 'Introduction': 0.9991699457168579, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.1502610419711345e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 1.0257900839860667e-06, 'MeetingNumber': 5.115915087117173e-07, 'MeetingSegment': 9.08781512407586e-05, 'MeetingStatus': 1.925738843056024e-06, 'OralStatement': 2.8106404356686987e-11, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.299087827850599e-05, 'RVRequested': 4.35504516644869e-05, 'RVTaken': 6.836347665739595e-08, 'Session': 6.07738513735967e-07, 'Sponsorship': 3.8752950848319756e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.1945079424767755e-05, 'Vote': 3.6411442124517635e-05, 'VotingIntention': 4.963443984706828e-07}\",\n[[\"Ghalia Bint Mohammad Bin Hamad Al-Thani\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Qatar\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 81,\n            'f': \"81\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 81,\n            'f': \"81\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9996578693389893,\n            'f': \"0.9996578693389893\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Sheikha Al-Thani (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): I would like, at the outset, to convey to you the greetings of His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Emir of Qatar, and His Highness\\u2019 wishes for the success of this important meeting, which aims at strengthening the continuous involvement of the nations of the world in the comprehensive global response to the spread of HIV/AIDS.

honour and privilege for me to represent Austria at this high- level meeting on HIV/AIDS. At the outset, I would like 14 to sincerely thank the Secretary-General for this timely opportunity to review the progress that has been made since the adoption of the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS in 2001 and the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS at the high-level meeting in 2006. First of all, allow me to take this opportunity to share with you information on the national achievements of Austria in the fight against HIV/AIDS. At a very early stage of the outbreak of the pandemic, Austria adopted specific legislation: on the one hand those measures grant high safety standards to prevent nosocomial infections and guarantees blood and product safety, and on the other hand they provide free access to testing, treatment and care. Since their entry into force, those legislative measures have been accompanied by exhaustive information campaigns, addressing both the general public and vulnerable groups. Those campaigns focused primarily on education and information about the main knowledge about HIV transmission and prevention, while also taking into account gender and discrimination questions. They were supported by an additional package of harm- reduction programmes for people at risk, and in particular by programmes for the provision of clean needles and syringes and a nationwide drug substitution programme. Moreover, effective measures in the field of vertical transmission and reproductive health have nearly eliminated mother-to-child transmission in Austria. From 1997 onwards advances in treatment led us to reinforce structures to provide nationwide, free access to treatment and care for all, both for intramural and extramural settings. This has led to a dramatic decrease in the number of new infections and people dying from AIDS. Nevertheless, prevention, which we see as the cornerstone of all other activities within the comprehensive approach to fight the pandemic, remains our main focus in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Due to excellent access to antiretroviral therapy, HIV/AIDS has become a chronic disease in the industrialized world. However, HIV/AIDS still causes a growing death toll in sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of the world\\u2019s people suffering from this disease live. This not only impedes the successful achievement of Millennium Development Goal 6, but also has a very negative influence on reaching the other Millennium Development Goals in sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, it negatively affects the fight to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, to combat child mortality and to improve maternal health. HIV/AIDS not only means great human suffering, but leads in consequence to a dramatic decrease in life expectancy. High mortality rates of adults in productive age have a very negative impact on all aspects of human, social and economic development in the region. Austria notes with growing concern the feminization of the pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa, which is the result of power imbalances between men and women. Currently, 61 per cent of people living with HIV/AIDS in the region are women. Increasing numbers of women, including young women and even girls, are becoming infected. Only a few pregnant women who are HIV-positive receive the necessary services to prevent the transmission of the virus to their newborns. Care of orphans becomes a pressing social problem in the region, as 80 per cent of the children worldwide who have lost one or two parents to the pandemic live in sub-Saharan Africa. Austria is fully committed to meeting its international obligations on official development assistance. Our Government programme explicitly recognizes the resolutions of the Council of the European Union, in accordance with which a share of 0.56 per cent of gross national income is to be used for development cooperation purposes by 2010. Before concluding, I am proud to announce that Austria has been chosen to host the eighteenth International AIDS Conference, which will take place in Vienna in July 2010. The International AIDS Conference is the largest international meeting on HIV/AIDS, where every two years all stakeholders in the global response to the epidemic meet to assess progress and identify future priorities. The Conference is being organized by the International AIDS Society in partnership with the Austrian Government, the city of Vienna and local scientific and community leaders, who have a long history of involvement in HIV/AIDS issues. I am convinced that the 2010 Conference will be a very valuable contribution towards achieving the Millennium Development Goal of providing universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.5660502583614289e-07, 'ActionObject': 4.445185197710089e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 3.332531548494444e-07, 'Body': 4.469923986505364e-09, 'Clarification': 2.6593215807224624e-07, 'Conclusion': 6.311221056876093e-08, 'Election': 3.077406631746271e-07, 'General': 0.999992847442627, 'Introduction': 2.328978325749631e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 4.241366369228672e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 2.0850927739957115e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 2.7580888684042293e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 1.525848119854345e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 1.0245433657019021e-07, 'OralStatement': 2.1580866871317994e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 7.812680991037269e-08, 'RVRequested': 3.3741720528723818e-09, 'RVTaken': 1.3993159519998244e-08, 'Session': 5.819417481234268e-08, 'Sponsorship': 7.457543205191541e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.1767448171440265e-07, 'Vote': 1.8875890361869097e-07, 'VotingIntention': 1.1008410183421802e-06}\",\n[[\"Kdolsky\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Austria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Austria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"14\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2001\", \"DATE\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Austria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Austria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Austria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"1997\", \"DATE\"], [\"Austria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Austria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"Austria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"eighteenth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"July 2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"two years\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 114,\n            'f': \"114\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 114,\n            'f': \"114\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999914169311523,\n            'f': \"0.9999914169311523\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The Acting President: I next call on His Excellency Mr. Evgeniy Zhelev, Minister of Health of Bulgaria.\",\n\"{'Action': 7.733433338152906e-10, 'ActionObject': 4.138334674941291e-10, 'AgendaStatus': 1.1970662683324917e-07, 'Body': 8.516659599777654e-11, 'Clarification': 4.1303779840795585e-10, 'Conclusion': 9.164295988739468e-09, 'Election': 4.9574609306546336e-08, 'General': 2.0274353573768167e-06, 'Introduction': 0.9999914169311523, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.1537223953972386e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 9.95076132603856e-10, 'MeetingNumber': 5.906481415074438e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 6.2009797296980196e-09, 'MeetingStatus': 4.634646444401369e-09, 'OralStatement': 2.302866325485097e-16, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.527551034996577e-06, 'RVRequested': 1.562902184559789e-06, 'RVTaken': 2.2966302470894817e-11, 'Session': 1.4296029637872465e-10, 'Sponsorship': 2.840829513902493e-13, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.183099780950215e-07, 'Vote': 3.0846490517433267e-06, 'VotingIntention': 1.1683206624368836e-09}\",\n[[\"Evgeniy Zhelev\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Bulgaria\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 115,\n            'f': \"115\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 115,\n            'f': \"115\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9568771719932556,\n            'f': \"0.9568771719932556\",\n        },\n\"MeetingSegment\",\n\"15 \",\n\"{'Action': 3.7170551081544545e-07, 'ActionObject': 1.7740472981904432e-15, 'AgendaStatus': 7.919348945506499e-07, 'Body': 0.0012811074266210198, 'Clarification': 7.14477782493006e-11, 'Conclusion': 5.183696805133309e-10, 'Election': 1.3201004549046047e-05, 'General': 1.0450507214766346e-16, 'Introduction': 5.785754091536949e-14, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.375499381062184e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 0.00043236883357167244, 'MeetingNumber': 0.016215942800045013, 'MeetingSegment': 0.9568771719932556, 'MeetingStatus': 9.58709824772086e-06, 'OralStatement': 5.6063182540810885e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 6.926720086397609e-09, 'RVRequested': 1.0499905300775936e-07, 'RVTaken': 2.2326175894704647e-05, 'Session': 0.02514703758060932, 'Sponsorship': 9.123448524439581e-12, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 9.166151865303007e-11, 'Vote': 1.3454155567416137e-09, 'VotingIntention': 3.8231734444948984e-10}\",\n[[\"15\", \"CARDINAL\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 116,\n            'f': \"116\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 116,\n            'f': \"116\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.999976396560669,\n            'f': \"0.999976396560669\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Zhelev (Bulgaria) (spoke in French): On behalf of the Bulgarian Government, I thank the Secretary-General, the President of the General Assembly and the Executive Director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) for their concerted action in organizing, leading and advancing the global response to HIV. I am grateful for the honour of participating in this high-level meeting and sharing with other representatives the successes and challenges in the response to HIV in Bulgaria. Our country is situated in the region where the epidemic is growing most rapidly. The Bulgarian Government has proved that an effective national response to HIV becomes reality when strong political will and national leadership are combined with joint actions and significant financial resources. Since 1997 we have had one unified coordinating body \\u2014 the National Committee for AIDS Prevention \\u2014 and since 2001 the Bulgarian Government has supported the implementation of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and Action Plan. During the past eight years annual allocations from the Ministry of Health budget to fight AIDS have increased by almost six times. Since the beginning of 2004 Bulgaria has succeeded in significantly increasing access to and coverage of HIV-prevention services among the populations at higher risk, as well as care and support for people living with HIV. Bulgaria is today implementing an integrated, balanced approach incorporating prevention, treatment and care and support for people affected by the disease. The efforts of the Government and other partners in the response to AIDS have been very successful. Our achievements are as follows. The human and institutional capacity for HIV prevention, treatment, care and support has been considerably strengthened. National standards and best practices for the provision of specific services to populations most at risk have been boosted. These services are easily accessible, free and non-discriminatory. Access to them is increased by mobile medical units, centres for injecting drug users and community-based health and social centres for Roma people. People living with HIV also receive quality medical care, treatment of opportunistic infections, and psychological and social support. Despite the success achieved so far, Bulgaria faces the following challenges. We need to ensure the sustainability of the financial resources allocated to the national response to HIV, and to increase them; to scale-up and increase the coverage of services to prevent HIV infection and reduce the harm to the health of populations most at risk; and to ensure that all young people have access to health education. On behalf of the Bulgarian Government, I again confirm our readiness to achieve our national goals and implement the undertakings in the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS. I also call for the will, commitment and action of other leaders gathered here. \",\n\"{'Action': 3.464176643319661e-07, 'ActionObject': 5.323452256789096e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 1.912440666274051e-06, 'Body': 1.3582163838066208e-08, 'Clarification': 4.61469966239747e-07, 'Conclusion': 1.2944954619342752e-07, 'Election': 6.951627256057691e-07, 'General': 0.999976396560669, 'Introduction': 1.0960841791529674e-05, 'MeetingDateTime': 5.148763904117004e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 5.001819545213948e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 7.854133343698777e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 5.101379429106601e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 3.965809014516708e-07, 'OralStatement': 2.80086339898844e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.45144769653416e-07, 'RVRequested': 1.2880396305092745e-08, 'RVTaken': 2.6894660720699903e-08, 'Session': 8.680361673896186e-08, 'Sponsorship': 2.535890430976906e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.1683808288107684e-07, 'Vote': 1.904402608943201e-07, 'VotingIntention': 1.5364314549515257e-06}\",\n[[\"Zhelev\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Bulgaria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Bulgaria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"1997\", \"DATE\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"since 2001\", \"DATE\"], [\"past eight\", \"PARA\"], [\"annual\", \"DATE\"], [\"almost six\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the beginning of 2004\", \"DATE\"], [\"Bulgaria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Bulgaria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Bulgaria\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 117,\n            'f': \"117\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 117,\n            'f': \"117\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.990571916103363,\n            'f': \"0.990571916103363\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency Ms. Christine Nebout-Adjobi, Minister in charge of HIV/AIDS of C\\u00f4te d\\u2019Ivoire.\",\n\"{'Action': 1.2475798172317809e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.7008013886155027e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 4.871940291195642e-06, 'Body': 3.820145089150628e-09, 'Clarification': 2.288352085599854e-08, 'Conclusion': 2.429570031381445e-06, 'Election': 1.5153594290495676e-07, 'General': 0.009399548172950745, 'Introduction': 0.990571916103363, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.0601526323483768e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 1.9302459008940787e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 4.419807453359681e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 4.941370661981637e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 1.4254909785904601e-07, 'OralStatement': 3.608167367316617e-12, 'PresidingOfficer': 5.645375495078042e-06, 'RVRequested': 2.5318909138150048e-06, 'RVTaken': 4.41896252922902e-09, 'Session': 2.1253928395026378e-08, 'Sponsorship': 7.680187735781274e-11, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.179367131953768e-06, 'Vote': 5.626102392852772e-06, 'VotingIntention': 6.598259574275289e-07}\",\n[[\"Christine Nebout-Adjobi\", \"PERSON\"], [\"C\\u00f4te d\\u2019Ivoire\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 118,\n            'f': \"118\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 118,\n            'f': \"118\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999985694885254,\n            'f': \"0.9999985694885254\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Nebout-Adjobi (C\\u00f4te d\\u2019Ivoire) (spoke in French): On behalf of the President of the Republic of C\\u00f4te d\\u2019Ivoire, His Excellency Mr. Laurent Gbagbo, I wish to express gratitude for the invitation to speak before the Assembly. I also thank the Organization, its Secretary-General and the whole international community for their involvement in helping to resolve the crisis my country has experienced for nearly six years. I also thank the Executive Director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the United States Government \\u2014 through the President\\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) \\u2014 for their support in the fight against My delegation fully supports the statement made by the Minister of Health of Antigua and Barbuda on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. C\\u00f4te d\\u2019Ivoire, with an estimated population of more than 20 million, is the West African country most affected by the HIV pandemic, having a prevalence of 4.7 per cent and seeing a clear feminization of HIV. This is a gloomy picture, but my country\\u2019s social and political problems have not dampened its desire to stem this scourge, and we have a steadfast commitment to halt and reverse the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2015. The Government\\u2019s determination, the strong involvement of civil society and the private sector and 16 the support of the international community have enabled C\\u00f4te d\\u2019Ivoire to make the progress described in this year\\u2019s report, the main items being as follows. From 2005 to 2007 the funds devoted by C\\u00f4te d\\u2019Ivoire and its financial partners to combat AIDS totalled about $80 million, with the State\\u2019s contribution being about 15 per cent. It is significant that, despite the country\\u2019s crisis, C\\u00f4te d\\u2019Ivoire\\u2019s share has increased regularly since 2002. With regard to safety of transfusion, 100 per cent of transfused blood units are systematically tested for There is also progress in the number of people receiving antiretrovirals (ARV), up from 36,000 in 2006 to about 50,000 today; in the percentage of seropositive pregnant women receiving ARV, which has risen from 11 per cent in 2006 to 17 per cent in 2007; and in the percentage of people living with HIV still under treatment 12 months after its start, which has gone up from 87 per cent in 2006 to 89 per cent in Since 2004 particular attention has been given to patients co-infected with tuberculosis, of whom 90 per cent are on cotrimoxazole and 26 per cent on ARV. There is increased knowledge about HIV since the introduction of the subject, in 2006, into schools\\u2019 and colleges\\u2019 curriculums and training programmes for working life. There has also been a noteworthy change in the behaviour of young people, who are waiting longer and longer for their first sexual experiences. Challenges to be overcome include the low level of knowledge about HIV among young people, estimated to be about 22 per cent; the low level of screening, estimated at 3.5 per cent of the general population; and the inadequate use of condoms in high- risk situations, which is estimated at less than 50 per cent, whatever the age group. However, steps are being taken to meet these challenges. Four main obstacles are being encountered: the political and military crisis; the difficulty in disbursing financing; the persistence of gender inequalities; and insufficient alignment of partners and coordination of activities in the fight against AIDS. To respond to them, my country is taking action that should allow it to attain the special session goals.

Although there are concerns about the pace of progress, we also need to recognize the significant gains and lessons learned from each other\\u2019s success stories. Some countries in our region have shown very positive results in containing the prevalence of HIV/AIDS. But, of course, much more needs to be done to sustain this progress and consolidate these gains. The first case of HIV infection in Sri Lanka was detected in 1987. Reliable surveillance estimates indicate that there are at present about 5,000 persons infected with HIV among our 20 million population. So far only 917 HIV-positive cases have been detected, and only 3 instances of HIV infection following blood transfusion have been detected in 20 years. I present this data with modest pride. Representatives may ask what factors have contributed to Sri Lanka\\u2019s success. First, we have had strong political commitment and political will consistently over the years, and this has provided a firm foundation for the successful launch and continuation of HIV/AIDS prevention activities. The President of Sri Lanka chairs the National Committee for the Prevention of HIV/AIDS, which is identified as an essential element for ensuring good health in the Mahinda Chintanaya, the policy framework of the Government of Sri Lanka. Secondly, Sri Lanka has had free health care and education for all its citizens since gaining independence in 1948. Since then, despite being a developing economy, we have succeeded in building an extensive health-care infrastructure focused on primary health care. Sri Lanka has achieved low maternal and infant mortality rates, high vaccination coverage, an average life expectancy of 73 years and a literacy rate of 95 per cent. The strong health-care system, of which the HIV preventive programme is an integral part, and free education, which has resulted in a highly literate population, have contributed greatly to Sri Lanka\\u2019s success in combating HIV infection. Thirdly, the traditional and conservative nature of Sri Lankan society holds a deep and abiding respect for the sanctity of the family as an institution. Fourthly, Sri Lanka has set in place a well- established national HIV/AIDS control programme, with the strong support of the World Bank, the World Health Organization, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), UNICEF, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Global Fund. Sri Lanka is thankful to these institutions and donors for their support. I have personally given political leadership to advocacy and awareness programmes targeting political leaders in Parliament and in local government, 19 and all segments of civil society. These interventions have contributed significantly to acceptance by the entire political and religious leadership of the country that HIV/AIDS is a serious threat to national health and development. They have also served to attenuate stigma and discrimination. These efforts paved the way for the success of the Eighth International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific, which was held in Sri Lanka in August 2007. Around 2,700 foreign delegates and 2,000 local delegates attended. Sri Lanka provides antiretrovirals free of charge to all those who need them. Our financial commitment to free health care has not been compromised, in spite of our being burdened with substantial defence expenditure to meet threats and sabotage by an armed group described by several Member States of the United Nations as the most ruthless and organized terrorist outfit in the world. In conclusion, I wish to focus attention on the impact of the current unprecedented escalation of the price of oil and threats to food security. This, if not addressed immediately, has the potential to create a ripple effect in weakening health systems, affecting access to affordable drugs and treatment, and impeding research and development, and it could even reverse the gains achieved in developing countries. As we stand at the midway point towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, it is important that all stakeholders \\u2014 Governments, private sector, civil society \\u2014 use this opportunity to rededicate efforts to identify all challenges and address them, seeking sustainable ways to halt and roll back the spread of HIV/AIDS. \",\n\"{'Action': 3.421960670380031e-08, 'ActionObject': 2.208886407117916e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 6.601576529874364e-08, 'Body': 4.957284582829402e-10, 'Clarification': 4.6057259339704615e-08, 'Conclusion': 3.183920904703541e-09, 'Election': 1.7644121896864817e-07, 'General': 0.9999988079071045, 'Introduction': 4.382181941764429e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.4457828712011178e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 2.230954621040837e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 5.223230736817186e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 2.2783272868309723e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 1.7366774685001474e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.7556949671870825e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.1371111163782643e-08, 'RVRequested': 5.310554773707565e-10, 'RVTaken': 1.0404543893116625e-09, 'Session': 6.783411166111364e-09, 'Sponsorship': 6.228941362707019e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.2823177186760404e-08, 'Vote': 3.9722554134868915e-08, 'VotingIntention': 6.673294450365574e-08}\",\n[[\"Soborun\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Mauritius\", \"UNPE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Sri Lanka\", \"UNPE\"], [\"1987\", \"DATE\"], [\"about 5,000\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"20 million\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"only 917\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"only 3\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"20 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sri Lanka\", \"UNPE\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"the years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sri Lanka\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sri Lanka\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Secondly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Sri Lanka\", \"UNPE\"], [\"1948\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sri Lanka\", \"UNPE\"], [\"73 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sri Lanka\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Thirdly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Fourthly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Sri Lanka\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sri Lanka\", \"UNPE\"], [\"19\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Sri Lanka\", \"UNPE\"], [\"August 2007\", \"DATE\"], [\"Around 2,700\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2,000\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Sri Lanka\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 160,\n            'f': \"160\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 160,\n            'f': \"160\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.999993085861206,\n            'f': \"0.999993085861206\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency Ms. Elsa Palou, Minister of Health of Honduras.\",\n\"{'Action': 2.7292992865746157e-10, 'ActionObject': 2.2281543277102855e-10, 'AgendaStatus': 2.629199968851026e-07, 'Body': 8.441487786559065e-11, 'Clarification': 7.055512285525367e-10, 'Conclusion': 3.5257329500382184e-08, 'Election': 3.830110006930454e-09, 'General': 4.353089479991468e-06, 'Introduction': 0.999993085861206, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.1725055648614813e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 2.5295983085982243e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 7.083451047940059e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 1.7214444980595545e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 4.3865386878394474e-09, 'OralStatement': 3.596185103719486e-15, 'PresidingOfficer': 7.407322755170753e-07, 'RVRequested': 4.964829258824466e-07, 'RVTaken': 3.2250944970169115e-11, 'Session': 5.6253675329021036e-11, 'Sponsorship': 6.167148497611408e-13, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 5.110977099320735e-07, 'Vote': 5.397495783654449e-07, 'VotingIntention': 7.3618489082605265e-09}\",\n[[\"Elsa Palou\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Honduras\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 161,\n            'f': \"161\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 161,\n            'f': \"161\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.999998927116394,\n            'f': \"0.999998927116394\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Palou (Honduras) (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of the Government and people of Honduras, I wish to express our sincere appreciation of the efforts made by the United Nations in responding to the HIV/AIDS epidemic\\u2019s challenges to the development and survival of mankind. We pay public tribute to our friend Peter Piot and all those others who form part of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). They have shown us the path to follow. We are sad to see 20 Peter leaving, but we are happy to see the results of his work. This meeting is taking place at a very important time in our history. In the early years of a new millennium, it is appropriate that people around the world should think about the future of our countries, and the future of the epidemic. We have seen the first man walk on the Moon, the end of apartheid in South Africa, and the signing of the peace agreements in Central America. But we have also seen the aberration of the Holocaust and ethnic conflicts and local wars that in the past 40 years have caused more deaths than the two World Wars together. We have seen the light of freedom, but also the void of poverty and the violation of human rights. We have reasons to feel proud, but also to be ashamed of mankind\\u2019s cruelty and hardness of heart. The HIV epidemic, I am sorry to say, has been a shop window displaying every possible discrimination in our cultures. People living with the virus have been victims of isolation and persecution, and all forms of human ingratitude have been shown to men and women whose only difference is to be HIV-positive. Women are the most affected, for biological, epidemiological and social reasons. The virus has reached to the very depths of our families. Women who have never left their homes have been affected by the pandemic. Their partners have died, and they are now heads of household, with no jobs, and fear the possibility of leaving their children orphans. We must face the challenge of the feminization of the epidemic in a comprehensive way, attacking the symptoms that have created it, such as male chauvinism, violence and poverty. Our First Lady, Xiomara Castro de Zelaya, aware of this reality, led the formation of the Coalition of First Ladies and Women Leaders of Latin America on Women and AIDS in order to meet the challenge of the feminization of the epidemic, a joint effort with our sisters in ICW Latina \\u2014 the regional body of the International Community of Women Living with HIV/AIDS \\u2014 with the support of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). For us, the epidemic is no longer a problem of public health; it has become a political and social problem that needs to be dealt with comprehensively. We are therefore devoting all our resources to such action so that it is not just one more promise. Since 2006, the year of the last Assembly meeting at which the special session commitments were examined, the Honduran State has made significant advances in increasing the levels of cover for the treatment of people living with HIV/AIDS. We have reached 57 per cent, with the support of the Global Fund. It is noteworthy that since 2002, when antiretroviral therapy first became available in Honduras, the number of people being treated has risen from 40 to 6,400 today. However, we are aware of the gap that we still need to close. Our challenge is to increase coverage in areas with difficult access and among vulnerable, traditionally marginal populations, as part of our national response. Accordingly, we now have 22 centres with doctors prepared to attend to people living with HIV/AIDS. Another successful strategy has been the prevention of transmission of HIV from mother to child. This programme has been integrated into 80 per cent of our prenatal care network. The challenge is to increase the access of pregnant women to prenatal medical consultations, lack of which is the reason for the low coverage stated in our 2008 country report. Despite our achievements, we know that the response will not be sustainable if there is no consistent agenda for prevention. We need to stress far more the promotion of safe sexual behaviour and the implementation of sexual education programmes based on scientific evidence and human rights, directed at boys, girls, adolescents, young people and the groups in our population most affected by the pandemic. In 26 years of the epidemic we have learned to recognize the very close link between it and human rights. In response, we have started to work on the defence of human rights, with two offices in the country\\u2019s two main hospitals and the implementation by civil society of observation points that will ensure comprehensive attention and care, with ethical values, for people living with HIV and AIDS. I take this opportunity on behalf of the Government of Honduras, while conveying the greetings of citizen President Jos\\u00e9 Manuel Zelaya Rosales, to thank the United Nations for its enormous efforts in assisting countries to find an effective response to the pandemic, which has become a threat to the life and development of all. I conclude by reiterating the commitment of Honduras to continue to make every effort on behalf of life and human dignity, and guarantee that we shall use all the support we receive transparently for the benefit of the neediest and most marginalized populations in our country. \",\n\"{'Action': 2.0294100622209044e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.0049720167160103e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 6.059520529788642e-08, 'Body': 2.710757729396107e-10, 'Clarification': 4.3570889118882405e-08, 'Conclusion': 6.088642479085138e-09, 'Election': 4.707436218609473e-08, 'General': 0.999998927116394, 'Introduction': 6.254550726225716e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 6.923499551447776e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 2.0269691702878845e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 2.691824319001057e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 8.325461919866939e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 2.0533713396275743e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.3802995191269929e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.4308482398917022e-08, 'RVRequested': 3.934616799039503e-10, 'RVTaken': 8.597763612172571e-10, 'Session': 3.18182080683016e-09, 'Sponsorship': 2.463846904277034e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 9.446854853933928e-09, 'Vote': 2.1253880433391714e-08, 'VotingIntention': 1.1159478674471757e-07}\",\n[[\"Palou\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Honduras\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Honduras\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Peter Piot\", \"PERSON\"], [\"20\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Peter\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the early years\", \"DATE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Moon\", \"PERSON\"], [\"South Africa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"past 40\", \"PARA\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Xiomara Castro de Zelaya\", \"PERSON\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"the year of the\", \"DATE\"], [\"2002\", \"DATE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Honduras\", \"UNPE\"], [\"40\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"6,400\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"22\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2008\", \"DATE\"], [\"26 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Honduras\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Jos\\u00e9 Manuel Zelaya Rosales\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Honduras\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 162,\n            'f': \"162\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 162,\n            'f': \"162\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999760389328003,\n            'f': \"0.9999760389328003\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The Acting President: I now give the floor to His Excellency the Honourable Khumbo Kuchale, Minister of Health of Malawi.\",\n\"{'Action': 1.0304749276102143e-09, 'ActionObject': 2.648454344722495e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 1.3360860862121626e-07, 'Body': 1.3883275085113667e-10, 'Clarification': 8.608856960634625e-10, 'Conclusion': 2.0666400146751585e-08, 'Election': 5.777897715830704e-09, 'General': 2.1986674255458638e-05, 'Introduction': 0.9999760389328003, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.1018936457718453e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 1.3720253821958295e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 6.051751877400591e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 6.358710180620619e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 2.814601218759094e-09, 'OralStatement': 9.952233942555136e-15, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.435144779155962e-07, 'RVRequested': 4.452978998870094e-07, 'RVTaken': 6.174452615859138e-11, 'Session': 5.01010517794942e-11, 'Sponsorship': 2.311284193548535e-12, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 9.126051736529917e-07, 'Vote': 1.3857501812708506e-07, 'VotingIntention': 5.6962452532616226e-09}\",\n[[\"Malawi\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 163,\n            'f': \"163\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 163,\n            'f': \"163\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.999993085861206,\n            'f': \"0.999993085861206\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Kuchale (Malawi): On behalf of His Excellency Dr. Bingu wa Mutharika, President of the Republic of Malawi, and indeed on my own behalf, I join previous speakers in congratulating the Secretary- General on successfully organizing this meeting. My delegation aligns itself with the statement made by Zambia on behalf of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The Malawi Government reaffirms its commitment to full implementation of the 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS and also the 2006 Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS. It is for this reason that Malawi\\u2019s National HIV/AIDS Policy and Action Framework addresses all the six commitments of the 2001 Declaration. The Malawi Government and its leadership remain fully and strongly committed to the fight against HIV/AIDS. The President, Dr. Bingu wa Mutharika, is himself the Minister Responsible for Nutrition, HIV and AIDS. HIV/AIDS is also one of the six priority areas in the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy, which is a home-grown, overarching national development policy for achieving sustainable economic growth and development. HIV/AIDS prevalence in Malawi among adults aged 15 to 49 years has declined from 14.4 per cent in 2005 to 12 per cent, according to the 2007 sentinel surveillance report. This has surpassed the universal access target of 12.8 per cent set in 2006. HIV/AIDS knowledge in Malawi is almost universal, and is translating into positive behavioural change. For example, condom use has increased from 47 per cent to 57 per cent among sexually active males, and from 30 per cent to 37.5 per cent among sexually active females. 21 Malawi has also registered a remarkable improvement in the number of people accessing HIV services. For instance, in 2007: 661,400 people were tested, compared with 283,461 in 2004; 280,446 pregnant women were tested, compared with 52,904 in 2005; 146,856 people were on antiretroviral therapy (ART), compared with 3,000 in 2003, with a survival rate of 78 per cent; 39 per cent of HIV-positive tuberculosis patients were started on ART, compared with 29 per cent in 2005; 53 per cent of the 1 million orphans and other vulnerable children received different types of assistance, including direct cash transfer. On fundamental freedoms and human rights to reduce vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, the National HIV/AIDS Policy provides a clear legal and administrative framework. The policy addresses the special needs of vulnerable groups and issues of stigma and discrimination in all settings. Malawi\\u2019s achievements have not been without significant challenges, which include human resource capacity, inadequate infrastructure, and donor fund disbursement procedures and procurement conditionalities, resulting in poor absorption of funds. On its part, the Malawi Government will continue to build and strengthen systems for effective HIV/AIDS service delivery. However, Malawi would request all donor partners to review and relax their disbursement conditionalities in order to expedite cash flow and programme implementation, while maintaining high- quality fiduciary requirements. I would stress the critical importance of international cooperation in our collective fight against HIV/AIDS. To this effect, Malawi thanks all cooperating partners for their unwavering support. I conclude by thanking the United Nations for honouring Malawi with the hosting of the global launch of the Silver Jubilee International AIDS Candlelight Memorial. \",\n\"{'Action': 4.410961480516562e-07, 'ActionObject': 2.344620675387432e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 3.285663581209519e-07, 'Body': 4.4885322125765015e-09, 'Clarification': 2.874348865589127e-07, 'Conclusion': 2.8482146419150922e-08, 'Election': 6.243614620871085e-07, 'General': 0.999993085861206, 'Introduction': 1.5660529015804059e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 8.071084067751144e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 3.403582979899511e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 2.9475240026499705e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 8.057583613663155e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 2.4013314714466105e-07, 'OralStatement': 1.807894847161151e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.5477083081805176e-07, 'RVRequested': 2.0756256713383436e-09, 'RVTaken': 1.3741630944252847e-08, 'Session': 7.511994226661045e-08, 'Sponsorship': 4.2115242848694834e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.2557519823985785e-07, 'Vote': 4.2508250430728367e-07, 'VotingIntention': 1.0563934438323486e-06}\",\n[[\"Kuchale\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Malawi\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Bingu\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Mutharika\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the Republic of Malawi\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Zambia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Malawi\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2001\", \"DATE\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"Malawi\", \"UNPE\"], [\"six\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Malawi\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Bingu\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Mutharika\", \"PERSON\"], [\"six\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Malawi\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Malawi\", \"UNPE\"], [\"15 to 49 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"2005\", \"DATE\"], [\"2007\", \"DATE\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"Malawi\", \"UNPE\"], [\"21\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Malawi\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2007\", \"DATE\"], [\"661,400\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"283,461\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2004\", \"DATE\"], [\"280,446\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"52,904\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2005\", \"DATE\"], [\"146,856\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"3,000\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2003\", \"DATE\"], [\"2005\", \"DATE\"], [\"1 million\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Malawi\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Malawi\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Malawi\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Malawi\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Malawi\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 164,\n            'f': \"164\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 164,\n            'f': \"164\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9997654557228088,\n            'f': \"0.9997654557228088\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The Acting President: I now give the floor to Her Excellency Ms. Naomi Shabaan, Minister of State for Special Programmes of Kenya.\",\n\"{'Action': 6.067419344724101e-10, 'ActionObject': 5.039822031926988e-11, 'AgendaStatus': 4.886745941234949e-08, 'Body': 4.069354922475732e-11, 'Clarification': 3.7498537608371407e-10, 'Conclusion': 2.208379434875951e-08, 'Election': 1.0361251412405181e-08, 'General': 0.00023153975780587643, 'Introduction': 0.9997654557228088, 'MeetingDateTime': 7.083320735512544e-11, 'MeetingLocation': 3.216225286095664e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 5.255372803603109e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 2.4545588672708618e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 4.476816251042237e-09, 'OralStatement': 1.3522104908976983e-15, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.512378725645249e-07, 'RVRequested': 1.587940658964726e-07, 'RVTaken': 3.2558161028317656e-11, 'Session': 2.1301042874011245e-10, 'Sponsorship': 7.80175728708199e-13, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.9558768826755113e-07, 'Vote': 2.2369208636519033e-06, 'VotingIntention': 6.985452660757119e-09}\",\n[[\"Naomi Shabaan\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 165,\n            'f': \"165\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 165,\n            'f': \"165\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.999995231628418,\n            'f': \"0.999995231628418\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Shabaan (Kenya): I take this opportunity to congratulate the President and the chairpersons of the panels during this high-level meeting on HIV/AIDS on their dedication in facilitating our deliberations. I 22 equally express our appreciation to the Secretary- General for the elaborate and focused reports on issues pertinent to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. My delegation joins the international community in paying tribute to the lost souls and those infected and affected by the HIV/AIDS scourge. We associate ourselves with the statement made on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and that to be made on behalf of the African Group. The HIV infection rate in Kenya declined from 14 per cent in 2001 to 5.1 per cent at the end of 2006. This rate was based on data taken from pregnant women attending antenatal clinics and calibrated to the household survey data, the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey, conducted in 2003. A more recent household survey \\u2014 the Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey \\u2014 was completed in December 2007, and the data are currently being analysed. These data will provide more detailed information on HIV/AIDS and other related sexually transmitted infections in Kenya. Since the last Assembly meeting on this item, held here in June 2006, Kenya has made commendable progress on acceleration towards universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care services. The number of patients on antiretrovirals increased from 65,000 reported in 2006 to the current total of 190,000, an increase of almost 200 per cent in less than two years. This alone averted 90,000 deaths between 2006 and 2007. Counselling and testing sites have grown from three in 2000 to over a thousand in 2007, while the target of providing services for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission services in 80 per cent of all the health facilities by 2010 has already been met. In addition, testing strategies have been expanded to include voluntary counselling and testing, mobile counselling and testing centres, moonlight counselling and testing, camel-back counselling and testing, door- to-door counselling and testing, and early childhood diagnosis. Eighty-eight per cent of the orphans are now schooling. Despite this progress, HIV/AIDS continues to be a major concern to the Government of Kenya. Currently 1.1 million adults and 100,000 children are living with HIV and AIDS. An additional 250,000 patients require to be put on antiretrovirals today. We also continue to face problems regarding funding, shortage of workers, inadequate health infrastructure, stigma and high levels of poverty, which hinder the realization of universal access. Other concerns include inadequate care and treatment, particularly targeting most-at-risk populations, low reach-out to orphans and vulnerable children, due to increasing numbers, and a weak monitoring and evaluation system. The Kenya Government continues to take the fight against HIV/AIDS seriously, due to its devastating impact on the social, economic and development dimensions of the economy and communities. As I mentioned earlier, its efforts have borne relative success, but we still face enormous challenges in our fight against the scourge. Notable among the challenges are the following. The first is finance for scaling-up of AIDS responses in Kenya. Overall, during the financial years 2006-2007 and 2005-2006 the country spent from the combined donor and Government sources 1.3 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively of gross domestic product on HIV/AIDS response. The expenditure lags behind our Strategic Plan\\u2019s financial resource requirements. There was a significant closing of the gap in 2006-07, thanks to expenditure of the funds from the United States President\\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Over the past five years, combating the HIV/AIDS epidemic has received significant funding, primarily from donors through bilateral arrangements and the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS. There is a need to explore alternative financing arrangements to complement donor support. Secondly, there is the question of health human resources in Kenya. Provision of quality health services is a labour-intensive business which requires qualified health workers. Investment of up to $50 million per year for five years is required to put in place a reasonable number of members of the health workforce able to deliver quality health care. The third challenge is that of affordable commodities and low-cost technologies. Drugs, medical supplies and equipment are major factors contributing to the high cost of health care. Legislative reforms to facilitate use of high-quality generic drugs and standardized medical equipment in the health sector could reduce costs. Increased investment in low- cost prevention technologies, such as microbicides, vaccines, condoms, school health education, voluntary counselling and testing and community mobilization to fight stigma discrimination could also reduce health- care costs. Fourthly, there is the question of human rights, stigma and discrimination and gender equity. Awareness of legal, treatment, care and reproductive rights among people living with HIV/AIDS and among health workers needs to be enhanced. Stigma and discrimination contribute to low utilization of voluntary counselling and testing services, especially in rural areas. Strategies to effectively address prevention among most-at-risk populations \\u2014 men having sex with men, commercial sex workers and injecting drug users \\u2014 are being put in place. Investing in community organizations led by women is a feasible strategy to fight stigma and ensure gender equity. We have produced a universal access targets scorecard. I conclude by drawing attention to some of the areas in which we feel urgent follow-up action needs to be taken. Sustainability of HIV/AIDS funding is critical. Antiretroviral therapy is a life-long commitment; therefore, people put on treatment should have sustained access to drugs. Funding for prevention programmes has been inadequate. This should be enhanced, since prevention is the best way to fight HIV/AIDS. Financial support for fighting HIV/AIDS should be provided in the form of grants, not loans. Kenya and other low- and middle-income countries should be considered for debt relief without conditionalities, and the funds should be channelled to other priority areas, including the Total War against \",\n\"{'Action': 2.7295124027659767e-07, 'ActionObject': 4.4181387437447484e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 4.57885192872709e-07, 'Body': 3.661478231720139e-09, 'Clarification': 2.7816778924716346e-07, 'Conclusion': 2.0820706936319766e-08, 'Election': 3.3590904990887793e-07, 'General': 0.999995231628418, 'Introduction': 4.923239771414956e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 4.461053038085083e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 1.7502412674730294e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 2.6604400460428224e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 9.4978776132848e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 1.6070464425865794e-07, 'OralStatement': 5.910919185225794e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 6.691931275781826e-08, 'RVRequested': 1.2804109994490886e-09, 'RVTaken': 9.881449436477396e-09, 'Session': 4.8003926167439204e-08, 'Sponsorship': 2.9117131816747133e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 6.798001095376094e-08, 'Vote': 5.6466078035555256e-08, 'VotingIntention': 5.67084157410136e-07}\",\n[[\"Shabaan\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"], [\"22\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2001\", \"DATE\"], [\"the end of 2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2003\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"], [\"December 2007\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"], [\"June 2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"], [\"65,000\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"190,000\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"less than two years\", \"DATE\"], [\"90,000\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"between 2006 and 2007\", \"DATE\"], [\"three\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2000\", \"DATE\"], [\"2007\", \"DATE\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"], [\"1.1 million\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"100,000\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"An additional 250,000\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the financial years 2006-2007\", \"DATE\"], [\"2005-2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"2006-07\", \"DATE\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"], [\"past five\", \"PARA\"], [\"Secondly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"], [\"five years\", \"DATE\"], [\"third\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Fourthly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Stigma\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 166,\n            'f': \"166\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 166,\n            'f': \"166\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.999984860420227,\n            'f': \"0.999984860420227\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The Acting President: I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Victor Makwenge Kaput, Minister of Public Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\",\n\"{'Action': 3.1619986629038976e-09, 'ActionObject': 5.24626209141843e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 1.1834976021418697e-06, 'Body': 1.4086847244243472e-09, 'Clarification': 1.864883802937811e-09, 'Conclusion': 3.66290926478996e-08, 'Election': 8.154902531032349e-08, 'General': 8.641140425424965e-07, 'Introduction': 0.999984860420227, 'MeetingDateTime': 5.882551668001668e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 4.7847183992644204e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 5.253121049264564e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 3.3160131351905875e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 1.0780862425008308e-08, 'OralStatement': 2.2275663776115222e-14, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.709080265754892e-06, 'RVRequested': 4.657140380004421e-06, 'RVTaken': 2.7918001244131574e-10, 'Session': 2.324144765530889e-10, 'Sponsorship': 3.1018941755445173e-12, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 5.766985395894153e-06, 'Vote': 5.461528189698583e-07, 'VotingIntention': 8.115858207702331e-09}\",\n[[\"Victor Makwenge\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the Democratic Republic of the Congo\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 167,\n            'f': \"167\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 167,\n            'f': \"167\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.999998927116394,\n            'f': \"0.999998927116394\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Kaput (Democratic Republic of the Congo) (spoke in French): I take this opportunity to convey the warmest greetings of His Excellency Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who is personally involved in, and is following very closely, the implementation of our national and international responses to the AIDS pandemic. Being unable to attend, he asked me to represent him here at this high-level meeting. 23 I would also like in particular to sincerely congratulate the President of the General Assembly and the Secretary-General on having organized this high- level meeting devoted to the combat against HIV/AIDS. My delegation aligns itself with the statement to be made by the representative of Egypt on behalf of the Group of African States and the statement made by the representative of Zambia on behalf of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). My country, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, led today by a democratically elected Government, rejoined the international community in June 2001, as it participated in a remarkable manner in the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the AIDS pandemic as a factor of poverty, a brake on development and a threat to national and world security. During that special session, President Joseph Kabila, like most of his counterparts, made the commitment to send a strong signal by personally assuming the direction of the fight against HIV/AIDS. This commitment was progressively confirmed by, specifically, his address before the Congolese parliament in December 2003; by the creation by presidential decree of the national multisectoral programme to combat AIDS, which was placed under his authority in March 2004; by his 11 April 2006 address on the occasion of launching the campaign for universal access to prevention; by including the fight against AIDS as one of the pillars of my country\\u2019s growth and poverty reduction strategy in 2006; and by the 2008 vote by both houses of parliament on a draft law protecting the rights of people living with Today, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is experiencing a widespread AIDS pandemic, which is increasingly affecting women, rural populations and young people. Nationwide surveys have shown that HIV prevalence among the general population was 4.04 per cent at the end of 2007 and that the number of people living with HIV is estimated at 1,330,120. We also note a concentration of people living with HIV in those zones where there are intense population movements, in particular in those zones where there are internally displaced persons and in border zones. The same phenomenon is also observed in population concentration areas, such as mining areas, ports and river zones, which seem to be pools of economic activity. We have been seeing over this time that just less than one quarter of young people are 24 using condoms. At the same time, we are seeing more sexual violence against women as a consequence of the war. With 168,530 new infections, 347,490 people living with HIV who need treatment and of whom less than 10 per cent have access to such treatment and 104,900 AIDS deaths in 2007, my country has been hard hit by this pandemic and needs resources for a large-scale response. We need to read the situation within the very difficult social and economic context of the Democratic Republic of the Congo being a post- conflict country with close to 60 million inhabitants, of whom 60 per cent live in rural areas. Our road and transportation infrastructure is completely dilapidated, which leads to exponentially growing logistics costs. This situation is worsened by the weak health services coverage of the country due to the inadequacy, run- down state and the destruction of the social and health infrastructure and the population\\u2019s weak purchasing power. In the face of this situation, the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is sparing no effort to mobilize the resources so as to curb this scourge. These efforts include accelerated progress towards universal access to prevention, treatment and care. It is in this context that the issue of HIV/AIDS is now treated from the point of view of development because of its multisectoral character. That is why the fight against HIV/AIDS now takes its place among the priorities of our growth and poverty reduction strategy document and our Government\\u2019s priority action plan for 2007-2008. We must recognize at the same time that in spite of the Government\\u2019s unequivocal commitment, current resources cover barely a third of our national needs in fighting HIV/AIDS. In fact, the resources expended for fighting HIV/AIDS today reach a little less than $1 per capita per year. It is fitting to recall here that due to our country\\u2019s strategic position, bordering nine countries and at the crossroads of three African regions, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has a crucial role to play in the global fight against this pandemic. We are actively participating in all regional initiatives, including the Southern African Development Community\\u2019s AIDS initiative, the Great Lakes Initiative on HIV/AIDS and the Central African initiative of countries bordering the Oubangui, Chari and Congo rivers. To be sure, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is benefiting from the international community\\u2019s support in its tireless fight against HIV/AIDS, but looking at the scale of the pandemic and the country\\u2019s post-conflict situation, and in the light of the social and economic consequences mentioned previously, the available resources do not meet the country\\u2019s needs to reverse the current trend of the pandemic. If urgent arrangements are not made to rapidly meet this need for resources, the country could become a time bomb capable of destroying any of the efforts provided by neighbouring countries and possibly even by the entire region. That is why the Democratic Republic of the Congo is asking the entire international community for a greater and multifaceted commitment to fight this pandemic. Before this Assembly, where we see as many leading experts as leaders, I would like, on behalf of the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to express the thanks of the Congolese people to all those countries, organizations and individuals that have brought us constant and much appreciated support in this merciless combat against HIV/AIDS. Before concluding, allow me to pay tribute to all the pioneers in the fight against AIDS throughout the world and to all those people \\u2014 researchers, doctors, nurses and social workers \\u2014 who are committed to the fight against this pandemic and are braving all risks. I would like to pay a deserved tribute to those who are living with HIV/AIDS, who are fighting tirelessly, together with other players, to break the silence surrounding this pandemic and to contribute to eradicating the stigmatization and discrimination arising from HIV/AIDS. \",\n\"{'Action': 3.203403053930742e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.14223031033589e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 9.03965116094696e-08, 'Body': 3.7401856611829487e-10, 'Clarification': 4.151699428689426e-08, 'Conclusion': 3.6072156373023745e-09, 'Election': 7.761930476135603e-08, 'General': 0.999998927116394, 'Introduction': 3.738536520359048e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.050380937783757e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 2.8724377543198898e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 4.519467911023867e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 1.8857024031149194e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 2.483466232661158e-08, 'OralStatement': 2.9273268253859897e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.0650738957451722e-08, 'RVRequested': 3.1932917421428897e-10, 'RVTaken': 9.625311658822966e-10, 'Session': 4.620074545158559e-09, 'Sponsorship': 3.240778756463669e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.3595998993309877e-08, 'Vote': 2.0580529280778137e-08, 'VotingIntention': 9.20831340067707e-08}\",\n[[\"Kaput\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Joseph Kabila Kabange\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the Democratic Republic of the Congo\", \"UNPE\"], [\"23\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Egypt\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Zambia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"the Democratic Republic of the Congo\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"June 2001\", \"DATE\"], [\"Joseph Kabila\", \"PERSON\"], [\"December 2003\", \"DATE\"], [\"March 2004\", \"DATE\"], [\"11\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"April 2006\", \"PARA\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"2008\", \"DATE\"], [\"Today\", \"DATE\"], [\"the Democratic Republic of the Congo\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the end of 2007\", \"DATE\"], [\"1,330,120\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"24\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"168,530\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"347,490\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"104,900\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2007\", \"DATE\"], [\"the Democratic Republic of the Congo\", \"UNPE\"], [\"close to 60 million\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the Democratic Republic of the Congo\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2007-2008\", \"DATE\"], [\"barely a third\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"nine\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"three\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the Democratic Republic of the Congo\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Congo\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the Democratic Republic of the Congo\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the Democratic Republic of the Congo\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"the Democratic Republic of the Congo\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 168,\n            'f': \"168\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 168,\n            'f': \"168\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999963045120239,\n            'f': \"0.9999963045120239\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The Acting President: I now give the floor to His Excellency The Honourable Leslie Ramsammy, Minister of Health of Guyana.\",\n\"{'Action': 2.2014677580894926e-10, 'ActionObject': 4.342299853021814e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 4.020397454951308e-07, 'Body': 1.503904362154529e-10, 'Clarification': 2.5624469213170187e-10, 'Conclusion': 3.304167606188457e-08, 'Election': 3.316946051157288e-09, 'General': 9.724245728648384e-07, 'Introduction': 0.9999963045120239, 'MeetingDateTime': 3.248632959862441e-11, 'MeetingLocation': 4.868432879057139e-10, 'MeetingNumber': 6.983331690690875e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 1.1256072696141928e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 1.5433914146711913e-09, 'OralStatement': 4.9455869392432076e-15, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.1869478555581736e-07, 'RVRequested': 2.0830998437304515e-06, 'RVTaken': 4.7493346061466823e-11, 'Session': 3.765828968105289e-11, 'Sponsorship': 3.476155452895868e-13, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.715246469302656e-07, 'Vote': 2.3385632985650773e-08, 'VotingIntention': 1.2942262817006167e-09}\",\n[[\"Leslie Ramsammy\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Guyana\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 169,\n            'f': \"169\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 169,\n            'f': \"169\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999997615814209,\n            'f': \"0.9999997615814209\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Ramsammy (Guyana): Guyana is on track to meet its targets for universal access to prevention, treatment and care for HIV. Since the historic special session of 2001, the HIV epidemic in Guyana has been stabilized, and there are definite signs of reversal. Guyana would like to highlight one of our continuing struggles in the fight against HIV, namely, the problem of the outward migration of skilled health- care personnel. We are dismayed that an equitable solution is not anticipated soon. Guyana\\u2019s position is that recipient countries should assist developing countries to enhance their training capacity. Guyana has integrated the challenge of co-infection with tuberculosis into our fight against HIV. HIV-tuberculosis co-infection is already too deadly. A targeted global approach is required to deal with the problem, in particular given the growing issue of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. Our country has now adopted guidelines for earlier treatment of persons living with HIV. The treatment of persons living with HIV must not be restricted by imposed CD4 cut-offs or because of financial considerations. Since 2001, significant progress has been made in making medicines and commodities for the fight against HIV more affordable; but commodities, such as female condoms, and various laboratory reagents and medicines, such as those needed for second-line treatment, are still too expensive and inaccessible for too many. HIV services must become fully integrated into the provision of health care for all. Important links to maternal and child health, immunization, mental health and non-communicable chronic diseases programmes are crucial for success. We regret that we have not been able, for example, to persuade our partners that use of HIV funding for programmes such as visual inspection with acetic acid screening and testing and vaccination for human papilloma virus for cervical cancer is integral in the provision of effective anti-HIV programmes. We believe there is a need for a far more aggressive prevention strategy in which all tools are optimally utilized. The intensification of school education programmes on reproductive health, including about sexually transmitted infections, must be a major undertaking of countries. That must become a part of the leadership coming from the United Nations. The leadership of the United Nations is vital as we tackle those foci that still drive the epidemic in many countries. Commercial sex is still a major source of infection. Commercial sex workers, their clients and their bosses \\u2014 I am told that I cannot use the word \\u201cpimps\\u201d, but we are talking about pimps \\u2014 must be targeted in an aggressive programme to become part of 25 the solution, without restrictions owing to legal, cultural and religious considerations. Legislation is required to mitigate stigma and discrimination linked to HIV. There are existing laws that need to be amended or repealed, and there is a need for new laws to specifically address stigma and discrimination linked to HIV. The United Nations must take a leading role in ensuring that there is global agreement around those issues. In particular, I would like to highlight that workplace programmes, how we deal with health and life insurance, and immigration policies must occupy space on the global agenda. Guyana commends international efforts, in particular by developed countries, to mobilize resources. That ought to be strongly acknowledged. In their re-examination of eligibility criteria, we continue to urge donor countries, the Global Fund and other funding agencies to ensure that countries are not excluded merely on the basis of gross domestic product. It is time that we acknowledge unequivocally that HIV is a public health threat and that leadership in the fight to stop HIV must come from, and be integrated within, the public health system. The exceptionality of AIDS is not disputed, but that must not become a vehicle to shift responsibility from public health to some other authority or sector. Disease-specific responses have served us well, but it is time now to also focus on health system strengthening. We will not be able to provide effective HIV services on a sustainable basis unless we are able to build strong health systems. We cannot build capacity for human resources, a supply chain, information systems, health financing and so on vis-\\u00e0- vis HIV unless those health system gaps are addressed comprehensively in countries. I would like to join the Secretary-General, Prime Minister Douglas and other representatives in paying tribute to Dr. Peter Piot. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has been critical in coordinating advocacy and in ensuring that global focus on HIV is not distracted. There are other critical challenges confronting the world today, such as escalating food prices and climate change, among others. Those equally daunting challenges are compelling reasons for enhanced relevance and a strengthened UNAIDS as we move resolutely towards universal access and the Millennium Development Goals. I would be remiss, as the serving President of the World Health Assembly, not to remind everyone that we cannot go from meeting to meeting and ignore past agreements. This year, and in previous years, the World Health Assembly adopted significant agreements relating to HIV and tuberculosis. Those must be taken into consideration by this meeting and fully implemented if we are serious about universal access by 2010. \",\n\"{'Action': 2.8564594245494845e-08, 'ActionObject': 3.5736764658622633e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 1.0814758866217744e-08, 'Body': 9.737957662458996e-11, 'Clarification': 1.8843744342689206e-08, 'Conclusion': 5.09540076798487e-10, 'Election': 4.989556501300285e-08, 'General': 0.9999997615814209, 'Introduction': 6.968709165278142e-09, 'MeetingDateTime': 5.144513259836003e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 8.018380626140242e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 8.338221779702337e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 1.6508728606368095e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 1.0712008169377896e-08, 'OralStatement': 4.583978352457052e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.4638489026784782e-09, 'RVRequested': 2.28879554198258e-11, 'RVTaken': 3.357694122740895e-10, 'Session': 4.096771366590701e-09, 'Sponsorship': 3.220662625480486e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.2960438278142306e-09, 'Vote': 8.189749323150863e-09, 'VotingIntention': 2.207633365003403e-08}\",\n[[\"Ramsammy\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Guyana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Guyana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2001\", \"DATE\"], [\"Guyana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Guyana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Guyana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Guyana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2001\", \"DATE\"], [\"\\u201cpimps\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"25\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Guyana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Douglas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Peter Piot\", \"PERSON\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"This year\", \"DATE\"], [\"previous years\", \"DATE\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 170,\n            'f': \"170\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 170,\n            'f': \"170\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999734163284302,\n            'f': \"0.9999734163284302\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The Acting President: I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Gudlaugur Thor Thordarson, Minister of Health of Iceland.\",\n\"{'Action': 1.0361048685680885e-09, 'ActionObject': 3.382689461872701e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 1.4724435004609404e-07, 'Body': 3.2652458514803584e-10, 'Clarification': 1.3756903394224196e-09, 'Conclusion': 2.3766272505554298e-08, 'Election': 2.3324291831272603e-08, 'General': 2.3035318008624017e-05, 'Introduction': 0.9999734163284302, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.5529628411291583e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 1.8227231945999733e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 8.915222449168425e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 3.108296908749253e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 4.389808072602364e-09, 'OralStatement': 7.50484489684582e-15, 'PresidingOfficer': 5.892430863241316e-07, 'RVRequested': 9.240121698894654e-07, 'RVTaken': 7.719436895259335e-11, 'Session': 1.308625013907161e-10, 'Sponsorship': 3.838644246217937e-12, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.1920952829314047e-06, 'Vote': 6.052525236555084e-07, 'VotingIntention': 5.017824378228397e-09}\",\n[[\"Gudlaugur Thor Thordarson\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Iceland\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 171,\n            'f': \"171\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 171,\n            'f': \"171\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999997615814209,\n            'f': \"0.9999997615814209\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Thordarson (Iceland): At the outset, I would like to welcome the report (A/62/780) of the Secretary- General on the progress made mid-way to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in realizing the targets set out in the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS. It is encouraging to observe that since 2006 progress in containing the HIV epidemic is now being made in nearly all the regions of the world. However, as the report clearly shows, those positive trends are not uniform. Serious challenges remain. New infections continue to increase in several countries. Coverage for essential HIV prevention, treatment, care and support remains far too low in many parts of the world to have a major impact on the course of the epidemic. Especially in the countries most heavily affected by HIV, the epidemic\\u2019s impact, sadly, continues to grow, with increasing numbers of HIV- affected households and children orphaned or made vulnerable by HIV. Let me also say that I am deeply concerned about the overall expansion of the epidemic among women, children and vulnerable groups. Those groups must always be centrally involved in actions undertaken against the HIV epidemic. I want to emphasize what President Srgjan Kerim said in his opening speech, namely, that we cannot make progress when many teachers of children in some countries are dying from HIV/AIDS. Well-educated children are the hope for an AIDS-free world. The rate of progress in expanding access to essential services is failing to keep pace with the expansion of the epidemic itself \\u2014 a shortcoming that 26 is especially evident with respect to HIV prevention. Unless the international community takes immediate action to follow through on the pledges made to implement an exceptional response to HIV, the epidemic\\u2019s humanitarian and economic toll will continue to increase. It is only two years before the deadline for universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support and midway towards the target date of 2015 for achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Current trends suggest that the global community will fall short of achieving universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services without a significant increase in the level of resources available for HIV programmes in low- and middle-income countries. Substantially greater progress will be required to achieve universal access to HIV treatment and care. Much has been achieved in reducing prices for many first-line antiretrovirals over the last decade. Further price reductions for antiretrovirals will be needed to ensure the sustainability of treatment programmes, especially with respect to newer antiretroviral drugs. Accordingly, Iceland has adopted legislation on compulsory licensing to make it possible to assist those in need with affordable medicines facilitating our efforts in providing sustainable antiretroviral treatment coverage. An Icelandic pharmaceutical company is currently in the process of obtaining a prequalification licence from the World Health Organization to produce affordable antiretroviral drugs. I am pleased to be able to inform the Assembly that the Icelandic Government has decided to contribute to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria the sum of $1 million during the next three years. I was very moved, as I think we all were, to listen to Ms. Ratri Suksma this morning describing the situation of those living with HIV, and I want to echo Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\\u2019s remark that he admired the courage of people living with HIV. They are certainly the heroes of our time. To conclude, I would like to state that I truly believe we can reach the targets set out in the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS and the Millennium Development Goals. I agree with my colleague from Malawi that this must be done with a combined concerted effort by all nations. Tackling the epidemic is our common task. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.0767212899054357e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.3019033628935972e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 1.5908328876435007e-08, 'Body': 1.07499856238924e-10, 'Clarification': 1.6443802763888016e-08, 'Conclusion': 1.0991894061618268e-09, 'Election': 3.341661525269046e-08, 'General': 0.9999997615814209, 'Introduction': 8.993671940515924e-08, 'MeetingDateTime': 3.9774650240076426e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 1.403907745611832e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 1.4291575700653425e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 4.551125698526448e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 9.14157283204986e-09, 'OralStatement': 1.0053562427003726e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 4.3212629030620064e-09, 'RVRequested': 5.1667024825174934e-11, 'RVTaken': 3.164946638101185e-10, 'Session': 2.5518438473426386e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.8493087061699498e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 4.213583260082032e-09, 'Vote': 1.65845346344895e-08, 'VotingIntention': 4.924189056509931e-08}\",\n[[\"Thordarson\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Iceland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"A/62/780\", \"Symbol\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"Srgjan Kerim\", \"PERSON\"], [\"26\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2015\", \"DATE\"], [\"the last decade\", \"DATE\"], [\"Iceland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the next three years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Ratri Suksma\", \"PERSON\"], [\"this morning\", \"TIME\"], [\"Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\\u2019s\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Malawi\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 172,\n            'f': \"172\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 172,\n            'f': \"172\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9996206760406494,\n            'f': \"0.9996206760406494\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The Acting President: I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. David Homeli Mwakyusa, Minister for Health and Social Welfare of the United Republic of Tanzania.\",\n\"{'Action': 1.2070425547960895e-08, 'ActionObject': 3.483231703071965e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 2.3896982384030707e-06, 'Body': 3.553809024836596e-09, 'Clarification': 6.899528948167699e-09, 'Conclusion': 3.395103647108044e-07, 'Election': 5.551985395868542e-07, 'General': 0.0003557186864782125, 'Introduction': 0.9996206760406494, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.901223178890632e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 5.335889241564473e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 3.039167495444417e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 2.8002102681057295e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 7.003761481882975e-08, 'OralStatement': 3.5673916078116097e-13, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.110061697952915e-06, 'RVRequested': 6.186347036418738e-06, 'RVTaken': 2.383017783103014e-09, 'Session': 6.899870896859284e-09, 'Sponsorship': 2.6698230431998482e-11, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.689628220447048e-06, 'Vote': 6.146357918623835e-06, 'VotingIntention': 6.635088567463754e-08}\",\n[[\"David Homeli Mwakyusa\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the United Republic of Tanzania\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 173,\n            'f': \"173\",\n        },\n\"A_62_PV-103-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 173,\n            'f': \"173\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.999993085861206,\n            'f': \"0.999993085861206\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Mwakyusa (United Republic of Tanzania): I bring fraternal greetings from my President, His Excellency Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, who is unable to attend this important meeting owing to prior commitments. He sends his best wishes for a very successful event. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the President of the General Assembly and the entire United Nations on the convening of this high-level meeting to review progress in our commitments and in the global response to HIV/AIDS. I would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on this agenda item (A/62/780). My delegation associates itself with the statement delivered by the representative of Antigua and Barbuda on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and with the statements delivered by the representatives of Egypt and Zambia on behalf of the African Group and the Southern African Development Community respectively. Tanzania is among the countries in sub-Saharan Africa with a high HIV prevalence, which was 7 per cent in the 2004 demographic survey. Recently, we conducted another HIV/AIDS indicator survey; the preliminary results show that national HIV prevalence is declining and stands at 5.8 per cent. HIV transmission rates are declining as a result of effective prevention programmes and the commitment of the Government, development partners and other stakeholders. Prevention is at the core of all HIV strategies. We must stop new infections. That is our priority. The socio-economic impact of the epidemic in a poor country like Tanzania is enormous. We are witnessing an increase in AIDS-related morbidity and mortality, as well as increasing numbers of orphans in the community. HIV/AIDS puts an enormous burden on the already overburdened health-care system, as more than 50 per cent of hospital beds are occupied by patients suffering from AIDS-related conditions. 27 The effective mobilization of all sectors, including Government, our development partners and other stakeholders, is a key component and is essential for success. The interventions that are currently being implemented are based on our National Multisectoral Strategic Framework. The framework emphasizes a multisectoral approach, impact mitigation and delivery of antiretroviral drugs. The framework embodies the guiding principle of our efforts to fulfil our obligations as enshrined in the global Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS. Tanzania has enacted supportive HIV/AIDS legislation, which aims, among other things, to protect vulnerable populations and to further reinforce observance of the human rights, fundamental freedoms and legal protections of people living with HIV/AIDS, orphans and vulnerable children. Regarding HIV prevention, there are many organizations working with the Government in this area, including civil society and faith-based organizations, workplace programmes, programmes for members of the armed forces and programmes in refugee camps operated by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Other primary preventive programmes are being scaled up. In Tanzania, testing sites and voluntary counselling and testing services have been available since 1995, yet the uptake of these services has remained rather low. To this end, a voluntary counselling and HIV testing campaign was launched in July 2007 by the President of the United Republic of Tanzania, His Excellency Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, with the theme \\u201cTanzania free from AIDS is possible\\u201d. The overall response to the campaign has been very encouraging. At the end of six months, 4,211,767 people had been tested. We think that is a good example of the results that can be achieved when high political commitment is demonstrated. In responding to the plight of people living with HIV/AIDS, and considering the importance of care and treatment in the overall national response, the Government developed a HIV/AIDS care and treatment plan in 2003. This plan seeks to provide antiretroviral drugs free of charge to about 440,000 people living with HIV/AIDS. The provision of antiretrovirals to AIDS patients has brought new hope to thousands of people living with HIV/AIDS. Currently 143,451 patients are on treatment, and 276,761 have been enrolled and are being monitored. Regarding care and support to orphans and vulnerable children, efforts are ongoing to strengthen the coordination and harmonization of resources and interventions at the local government level to ensure that orphans and vulnerable children are identified and that they have access to basic services and support within the communities. Financing is a big challenge to already overburdened national budgets. Yet, its control is urgent and unavoidable. In order to ensure that there is a sustained response, HIV/AIDS has been mainstreamed in our National Strategy on growth and reduction of poverty. The prevailing shortage of human resources for health care has been a major setback in our fight against this pandemic. We would like to add our voices to those who are calling for support and the commitment of additional resources so that we can achieve the goal of universal access to HIV prevention and treatment by 2010. Tanzania has adopted the \\u201cThree Ones\\u201d principle. We have certain challenges, which we view as opportunities. One such challenge is the fact that levels of sexual and reproductive ill-health remain high. The existing weak health-care systems are now struggling with the additional burden of HIV. We have seen a sixfold increase in the number of tuberculosis cases. Other problems include sustaining care and treatment as well as prevention strategies; the increasing demand for nutritional support to poor community members who are infected and affected; the stigma of HIV/AIDS preventing access to prevention, testing, treatment care and support services; and the slow change towards positive behaviours that underpin a low risk of contracting HIV. In conclusion, I would like to acknowledge the financial support that we are receiving from our development partners. We call for increased and predictable resources. While many gains are being reported following the implementation of the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS and the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS, we are still far from reaching our goals. We need to redouble our efforts and sustain our gains. 28 Tanzania reaffirms its commitment to continue to implement the Declaration of Commitment and fully supports the initiatives undertaken by the Secretary- General in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Let us make a joint effort. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.1378569553244233e-07, 'ActionObject': 1.706527541500691e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 9.359100090478023e-07, 'Body': 2.5159374583694216e-09, 'Clarification':

},\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Minah (Sierra Leone): I have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the African Union member States. I thank you, Mr. President, for convening today\\u2019s debate on agenda item 121, on the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council and related matters. I would like to thank and congratulate our colleague Ambassador Lucas for taking up the appointment of Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations. We are ready to work with her and look forward to hearing her ideas on how she intends to guide our work. I would also like to thank Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, Permanent Representative of Jamaica and outgoing Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations, for the tremendous work and progress made during the sixty- ninth session, under the inspired leadership of President Sam Kutesa. At the outset I should like to reiterate Africa\\u2019s continued commitment to this very important item. We will work with all delegations and with you, Mr. President, and the new Chair to ensure that our deliberations, in accordance with General Assembly decision 62/557, are not only favourable to the Common African Position but also achieve our common objective. We were heartened during the Assembly\\u2019s general debate, when many Heads of State and Government reaffirmed the need to reform the Security Council in order to make it broadly representative, efficient and transparent and also to enhance its effectiveness, legitimacy and the implementation of its decisions. We remain committed to decision 62/557 and subsequent decisions. We hope that an acceptable outcome on the reform issue will be forthcoming during this session. We have continued to express our position in all previous intergovernmental negotiations meetings, including also populating the framework document that was circulated by the President of the sixty-ninth session on 31 July. Our participation in the current session of intergovernmental negotiations is firmly anchored on that platform. Going forward, the African Union Committee of Ten on Security Council Reform remains actively engaged in holding consultations with all member States, delegations and groups and remains open to new ideas and new initiatives on the question of reform of the Security Council. It is common knowledge that the Common African Position has gained momentum and continues to receive support in these deliberations for Africa\\u2019s legitimate claim for permanent membership in the Security Council, and to correct its under- representation in the non-permanent category. Our claim is based on an historical injustice, and we hope that it will be addressed without further delay. Further delay continues to perpetuate the injustice and also prevents Africa from taking its rightful place in the Security Council. There are several contentious elements on this issue of reform. One concerns the question of the veto. As we have said before and will continue to repeat, Africa\\u2019s preferred position is for the abolition of the veto, but if it continues to exist it must be extended to all new permanent members. We call for its abolition but are prepared to work with other delegations to see how there could be a possible limitation on the veto. We are of the view that the only solution that could be worthwhile on the question of Security Council reform is that which garners the widest possible acceptance, which will also allow a text to emerge and evolve during this session in an open, transparent, inclusive, balanced and comprehensive membership- driven manner. We are willing and able to work with all delegations to achieve this objective. On the question of whether the African position is a take-it-or-leave-it position, we prefer to reserve our comments on this issue in the format of formal negotiations, which we hope will commence soon. Any permanent seat that we are awarded, of course, will be held in accordance with the Charter. Our permanent seats and non-permanent seats will of course rotate as per the usual practice. At the appropriate time, Africa will select its candidates for the non-permanent seats in a manner of its choosing and will also, in keeping with the relevant Charter provisions, make that known to all. We call on and urge all delegations and interest groups to pledge themselves to a new commitment to action. In other words, let us build on the work and the achievements of the last session and move from there to real negotiations and, hopefully, to a conclusion that we can all live with. This session needs to build on the dramatic and unexpected progress made during the last session, as well as to increase the pace for more frank and lively debate on this issue. We feel that is the only way the necessary political will, will lead to the much-needed and much-delayed reform of the Security Council. The vision of our leaders at the 2005 World Summit has been much delayed, and we hope that with your help, Mr. President, we can all realize it in the not too distant future. The reform of the Security Council, as we all know, lies at the very core of the need to ensure that the United Nations remains at the heart of global governance and is also the key element in the maintenance of international peace and security. We wish to reiterate that the regrettable status quo continues to undermine the principles of equity, legitimacy, accountability and transparency in the work of the Security Council. It also undermines the Council\\u2019s effectiveness in its pursuit and stewardship of international peace and security. Therefore we affirm our commitment to the reform process and urge the membership as a matter of priority to move not only to correct the injustice done to Africa, but also to make sure that the Council is indeed truly reflective of the modern era we live in. Finally, we wish to assure you, Mr. President, of our continued support and constructive participation towards the early attainment of our common goal in reforming the Security Council. We assure all concerned that we will push and move for a truly interactive and productive session. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.1150605772058952e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.2356822232106879e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 3.7555675902467556e-08, 'Body': 1.3734628712125385e-10, 'Clarification': 5.4190859799518876e-08, 'Conclusion': 4.711388168487929e-09, 'Election': 1.2220410461338815e-08, 'General': 0.9999994039535522, 'Introduction': 2.604378437354171e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.9002886758888735e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 8.27197776942512e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 9.686682567178195e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 1.527375204091186e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 1.2261549997560905e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.610705524512923e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.1086983775498993e-08, 'RVRequested': 1.6870921326628263e-10, 'RVTaken': 4.730691949283994e-10, 'Session': 1.5235918082723288e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.4338121800960835e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.5059513070478943e-09, 'Vote': 4.721401047902418e-09, 'VotingIntention': 7.603911456044443e-08}\",\n[[\"Minah\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Sierra Leone\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"agenda item 121\", \"AI\"], [\"Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Courtenay Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Jamaica\", \"UNPE\"], [\"ninth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Sam Kutesa\", \"PERSON\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"decision 62/557\", \"D\"], [\"decision 62/557\", \"D\"], [\"31 July\", \"DATE\"], [\"One\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Charter\", \"PERSON\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 208,\n            'f': \"208\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 32,\n            'f': \"32\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999971389770508,\n            'f': \"0.9999971389770508\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Talbot (Guyana): In today\\u2019s debate on the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the Security Council, I have the honour to speak on behalf of the States members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). At the outset, Mr. President, CARICOM acknowledges your commitment to this issue, as demonstrated by the convening of today\\u2019s debate and your letter of 23 October, through which you announced the appointment of Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, as Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations. CARICOM has every confidence that with her vast experience, including as her country\\u2019s representative on the Security Council just recently, Ambassador Lucas will be able to add value to the process, building on the valuable work of the sixty-ninth session. CARICOM offers her its full support. In this connection, we take the opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Sam Kutesa, for his tenacious leadership and commitment to this issue and for reinvigorating the intergovernmental negotiations on reform of the Security Council during the sixty-ninth session. We also express our sincere appreciation to Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, Permanent Representative of Jamaica, for his effective stewardship of the intergovernmental negotiations. His leadership and commitment have brought the process to an important stage and provided us with a workable negotiating text. Despite the acknowledged differences on this important subject, this seventieth session presents us, as States Members of the United Nations, with a fresh opportunity to advance the deliberations on reform of the Security Council. With the consensus adoption of decision 69/560, the General Assembly now has a mandate to move the process forward by building on the informal meetings held during the sixty-ninth session, as well as on the positions of and proposals by Member States as reflected in the text and its annex circulated by Mr. Kutesa via a letter of 31 July 2015. It is therefore our expectation that the set text will be the working basis of the next round of the intergovernmental negotiations, allowing for real give-and-take negotiations in which positions merge, gaps are narrowed and areas of commonalities are used as building blocks towards the common objective of a reformed Security Council. We anticipate in this process that further and new ideas and proposals may emerge to enrich our deliberations. For its part, CARICOM has remained steadfast in support of the reform of the Security Council over many years, including throughout the intergovernmental negotiations. Our delegations are committed to playing a constructive role in the process. CARICOM maintains a principled advocacy for expansion in both the permanent and non-permanent categories of membership. The role and security of small States are key factors for CARICOM. In this context, we have proposed the inclusion of a special seat for small island developing States in the reformed Security Council. The region\\u2019s support for the inclusion of Africa and other developing countries in the permanent category of membership remains unwavering. With regard to the veto, CARICOM continues to call for the elimination of the veto. However, in the event of its retention, we consider that all permanent members of a reformed Security Council should have the same rights and prerogatives. In conclusion, let me assure you, Mr. President, of the full support of CARICOM delegations as you seek to advance the important cause of reform of the Security Council. \",\n\"{'Action': 4.63129126160311e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.590862019895667e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 2.3805029059076332e-07, 'Body': 8.289359199054047e-10, 'Clarification': 1.60787422487374e-07, 'Conclusion': 3.5547287779991166e-08, 'Election': 3.332003828404595e-08, 'General': 0.9999971389770508, 'Introduction': 1.565880097587069e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 8.270270690502457e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 6.63362627051356e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 5.821648940695923e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 1.6336088037860463e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 5.227510513350353e-08, 'OralStatement': 7.901024901002529e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 5.125365376557056e-08, 'RVRequested': 1.0224852076134994e-09, 'RVTaken': 3.5491038996582347e-09, 'Session': 8.895988834467516e-09, 'Sponsorship': 6.055716372799225e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.8150433095674998e-08, 'Vote': 2.394187070819953e-08, 'VotingIntention': 5.073201805316785e-07}\",\n[[\"Talbot\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Guyana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"23 October\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sylvie Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Luxembourg\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"sixty-ninth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Sam Kutesa\", \"PERSON\"], [\"sixty-ninth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Courtenay Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Jamaica\", \"UNPE\"], [\"decision 69/560\", \"D\"], [\"sixty-ninth\", \"TIME\"], [\"Kutesa\", \"PERSON\"], [\"31 July 2015\", \"DATE\"], [\"many years\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 209,\n            'f': \"209\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 33,\n            'f': \"33\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.999998927116394,\n            'f': \"0.999998927116394\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Rambally (Saint Lucia): I have the honour to take the floor today on behalf of a diverse group of 42 developing countries from Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Asia and the Pacific, who are united by a common cause \\u2014 to achieve lasting and comprehensive reform of the Security Council. Our group is bound by the firm conviction that expansion in both the permanent and non-permanent categories of membership of the Security Council is imperative to better reflect contemporary world realities and achieve a more accountable, representative, transparent and, importantly, relevant Security Council. We would like to begin by congratulating you, Mr. President, on commencing this process in earnest in your letter of 23 October 2015. We welcome the appointment of Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, as Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations. We are confident that Ambassador Lucas will successfully steer the process forward pursuant to the Assembly\\u2019s consensus decision 69/560 of 14 September, which fundamentally set the Security Council reform process on a negotiation path based on the text and its annex circulated by then President of the General Assembly in his letter of 31 July 2015. As a leading pro-reform group, the L.69 was one of the first groups to request early commencement of text-based negotiations through the intergovernmental negotiations process. We are therefore extremely heartened to note the progress achieved in the previous round through a consultative, transparent and inclusive process which is now being carried forward in the Assembly\\u2019s seventieth session. It is also a significant step forward that all Member States unanimously adopted decision 69/560, which is substantive and calls for building upon the text of 31 July and its annex. It is therefore important in this next round of the intergovernmental negotiations that we commence the process from where we left off in the previous round. We are now eager to engage in the actual negotiations on this text in the same manner as we negotiate texts elsewhere in the United Nations. All of us are party to both the General Assembly rules of procedure and the specific General Assembly resolution regulating negotiations on Security Council reform. The L.69 group of developing countries would also like to place on record its appreciation to the outgoing Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations, Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, for having steered this process successfully, leading to the consensus decision adopted at the sixty-ninth session. In recent years, we have all asked the Chair to produce a negotiation text, but we have never got one. Finally, with the adoption of decision 69/560 we know that we have in place a text that is recognized undisputedly by the entire membership. Now, therefore, it becomes critical that we move further ahead with a results-based time line as an absolute imperative. The L.69 group is fully committed and will constructively engage in the intergovernmental negotiations process, building further on the Assembly President\\u2019s negotiation text of 31 July. The objective is to move forward decisively during the ongoing seventieth session. The commitment of the L.69 group is to engage in a process that would yield results. However, we wish to place on record that should this process not move forward with the negotiation text as referenced by decision 69/560, then we are prepared to look at other options that would yield the results desired by the vast majority of the United Nations membership. This seventieth anniversary of the United Nations is an important opportunity to show decisive progress and finally deliver a decision mandated by our Heads of State and Government at the 2005 World Summit: to achieve lasting reforms of the Security Council. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.2440172270089533e-07, 'ActionObject': 1.0368500369395406e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 1.2830315654355218e-07, 'Body': 6.217971137978395e-10, 'Clarification': 1.570765419955933e-07, 'Conclusion': 7.703286897253747e-09, 'Election': 5.44034541860583e-08, 'General': 0.999998927116394, 'Introduction': 2.5419706162210787e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.177994235490587e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 2.1785144355135344e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 2.791712860883422e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 3.569601148001311e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 5.972555072730756e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.1411890454837703e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.771151308422759e-08, 'RVRequested': 4.4800976817249705e-10, 'RVTaken': 1.8389272327112849e-09, 'Session': 6.2039120507506595e-09, 'Sponsorship': 4.131940123386357e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.1879174088846867e-08, 'Vote': 7.970890614217296e-09, 'VotingIntention': 1.2438036378625839e-07}\",\n[[\"Rambally\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Saint Lucia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"42\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"23 October 2015\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sylvie Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Luxembourg\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"decision 69/560\", \"D\"], [\"14 September\", \"DATE\"], [\"31 July 2015\", \"DATE\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"decision 69/560\", \"D\"], [\"31 July\", \"DATE\"], [\"Courtenay Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"sixty-ninth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"recent years\", \"DATE\"], [\"decision 69/560\", \"D\"], [\"31 July\", \"DATE\"], [\"decision 69/560\", \"D\"], [\"2005\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 210,\n            'f': \"210\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 34,\n            'f': \"34\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999998807907104,\n            'f': \"0.9999998807907104\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Cardi (Italy): On behalf of the Uniting for Consensus (UfC) group, I wish to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this annual debate on Security Council reform and to warmly welcome the appointment of Ambassador Sylvie Lucas of Luxembourg to her new, pivotal capacity. We are confident that she will be attentive to the needs and concerns of all Member States to facilitate our collective endeavour in the coming months. Allow me also to thank Ambassador Courtenay Rattray of Jamaica for his efforts during the past negotiating session. We believe that the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly can be seen as a step forward on our path towards reform in terms of active participation by an increasing number of Member States. Countries that in the past had been on the margins of the debate decided to engage and to spell out their positions on the future of the Security Council. In our view, this is a material legacy. Our debate needs to be more inclusive, just as the Council we are striving to reform. Similarly, we need full transparency. The intergovernmental negotiations are a membership- driven process, mandated by Assembly decision 62/557. We need predictability through a clear agenda, not arbitrary guidance. Member States should be facilitated in their work through timely information and extensive consultation. Each Member State, belonging to any negotiating group, has the right to be adequately informed about the procedure. The past has demonstrated that divisive approaches and initiatives complicate our process even further, distancing us from reaching our commonly shared goal of reform. The UfC group has been tirelessly advocating a deeper discussion of the principles on which the Council\\u2019s reform must be based. Clarifying how we conceive the reform is a crucial undertaking that would facilitate negotiations. Proof of this was given to us by the negotiations on the method of selection and appointment of the Secretary-General under last year\\u2019s annual resolution on the revitalization of the work of the General Assembly (resolution 69/321). The collectively shared principle of a more transparent selection process was spontaneously translated into some concrete measures. We knew with clarity where we were heading so we achieved most of the expected results in only one year of work. We have all been talking for years about the common goal of a more representative, democratic, accountable and effective Security Council, but do we really agree on the meaning of these principles? Let me give a concrete example. Exactly one week ago, most of us attended the launch of a code of conduct supported by more than 100 countries, aimed at limiting the use of the veto and preventing Council inaction, thus making it more effective in the face of heinous international crimes. However, today we will still hear voices in favour of adding new national permanent members, so new veto powers, all while pursuing the same goal of making the Council more effective. The Uniting for Consensus group has been very forthcoming in clarifying how we interpret the reform principles that I have just mentioned. The UfC has already tackled the issue, most recently last year at the general debate and throughout the entire work session. Today, as a further contribution to the debate on the objectives of reform and to give substance to it, I would like to touch on an increasingly recurrent issue: the request for a Security Council that is representative of the realities of the twenty-first century. That is certainly an important concept because it suggests that Security Council reform should be reflective of the changes that have occurred in the last 70 years. Let me summarize the three main changes that have taken place. First, in these 70 years not only has the number of Member States grown, but the relative weight of the different regional groups of the United Nations has also changed. That has led the membership to unanimously request an enlargement of the Council to favour areas that to date have been disadvantaged in the distribution of seats. The response of Uniting for Consensus to this first trend is unequivocal. We support an enlargement of the Council up to 26 members, assigning the majority of added seats to Africa, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America. We also understand and heed the call of the Eastern European Group and of cross-cutting groups of States, such as small island developing States, small States and the Arab countries. Secondly, some Member States aspire to play a more prominent role in the Council. The UfC highly values the contribution that these States may offer to the maintenance of international peace and security. No one has asked them to forfeit their willingness to play a greater role in the Council. In fact, our proposal of longer-term seats with the possibility of immediate re-election was conceived precisely to meet these expectations. Let me clarify: these seats would not be reserved for a select group of countries. All Member States willing to make a bigger contribution to the work of the Security Council would have the right to run for a longer-term seat. Our proposal is democratic in nature. Thirdly, over the past 70 years we have experienced change at an incessantly faster pace in the international arena. The emergence of new regional actors and new global challenges imposes a modern vision for the Security Council, enhancing its flexibility not only in terms of operations, but also in terms of its very structure and representation. The reality of the twenty- first century is in continuous transformation, and a changing reality requires a Council able to adapt to it. We believe that regular elections are the best way to guarantee not only a truly democratic and accountable Security Council, but also a Council able to continually adapt to the rapid changes of today and tomorrow. That is what we mean by an inclusive Security Council. Let us offer to all Member States \\u2014 especially small States and developing countries, which represent the majority of the membership \\u2014 the opportunity to contribute more to the Council\\u2019s work. This goal can be achieved solely by ensuring a proper, fair and democratic system, through regular elections. That is what we mean by a Security Council in tune with the realities of the twenty-first century \\u2014 a new, modern Council grounded on a profoundly democratic vision that carries within it inclusiveness and adaptability. That is the path towards the early reform that our leaders called for more than 10 years ago \\u2014 a reform that can be attained with no further delay, building on the many already existing convergences among Member States; a comprehensive reform of the Security Council that can be concretely achieved by enlarging the Council with new elected members and by a more balanced and equitable representation of regional groups. Other areas that require our due attention.include an enhanced and closer relationship between the Security Council and the General Assembly; and improved working methods of the Council, including the question of the veto are also This is also the path towards a consensual reform of the Security Council that, due to its paramount importance, must be endorsed by all Member States. The Uniting for Consensus group stands ready to cooperate with you, Sir, the new intergovernmental negotiations Chair, and the entire membership to advance this process in good faith and in mutual respect, being guided by our strong conviction that a truly democratic Security Council reform is possible and within reach. \",\n\"{'Action': 5.2310928921883715e-09, 'ActionObject': 1.6952516057600064e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 1.5778480744188528e-08, 'Body': 2.8327347412204773e-11, 'Clarification': 1.0103005543271593e-08, 'Conclusion': 8.202111212440855e-10, 'Election': 1.845680230871949e-08, 'General': 0.9999998807907104, 'Introduction': 4.2072496597711506e-08, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.2819565409216693e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 3.4915716984329492e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 4.5615855537306516e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 5.289707782907271e-09, 'MeetingStatus': 6.435225685663681e-09, 'OralStatement': 3.3811535793404346e-09, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.7587752082780526e-09, 'RVRequested': 4.525419622369853e-11, 'RVTaken': 1.2173295704798193e-10, 'Session': 1.0293739194366935e-09, 'Sponsorship': 2.3055561626517118e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 5.471094133291388e-10, 'Vote': 4.543890153030361e-09, 'VotingIntention': 1.1246900299966e-08}\",\n[[\"Cardi\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Italy\", \"UNPE\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"annual\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sylvie Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Luxembourg\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the coming months\", \"DATE\"], [\"Courtenay Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Jamaica\", \"UNPE\"], [\"sixty-ninth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"decision 62/557\", \"D\"], [\"under last year\\u2019s\", \"DATE\"], [\"annual\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolution 69/321\", \"R\"], [\"only one year\", \"DATE\"], [\"years\", \"DATE\"], [\"one week ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"more than 100\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"last year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Today\", \"DATE\"], [\"the twenty-first century\", \"DATE\"], [\"the last 70 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"three\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"these 70 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Secondly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Thirdly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"past 70\", \"PARA\"], [\"the twenty- first century\", \"DATE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"tomorrow\", \"DATE\"], [\"the twenty-first century\", \"DATE\"], [\"more than 10 years ago\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 211,\n            'f': \"211\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 35,\n            'f': \"35\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999986886978149,\n            'f': \"0.9999986886978149\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I have the honour to make this statement on behalf of the Group of Arab States. I would like to convey to you, Mr. President, the support of the Arab Group in the work of the General Assembly at this session. I also wish to thank Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, Permanent Representative of Jamaica, for his work during the previous session. We welcome the appointment of Ms. Sylvie Lucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg as Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform. We wish her every success and assure her of our full cooperation. The international community is seeing increasing changes. We need to step up our efforts to strengthen the role of the Security Council so that it will be more effective and able to meet its challenges, more representative, transparent, neutral and credible. The reform of the Security Council and equitable representation thereon is one of the crucial pillars of the overall reform of the United Nations. More than 20 years of discussions on expanding the Council and improving its working methods have seen many international and regional initiatives crop up, including those of the Arab Group. But now, seventy years after the establishment of the United Nations and with the change in international realities, it is extremely important to make progress in reforming the Council, in the context of the unanimity of Member States on the need for change. However, we must not seek a hasty solution on which there is no consensus, nor must we have a deadline that would block a comprehensive solution to reform. In this regard, we reaffirm our stance that intergovernmental negotiations are the only forum in which to achieve an agreement on expansion in line with Assembly decision 62/557. That is the basis for these negotiations, stipulating that they be owned by the Member States. Recent developments in intergovernmental negotiations have proved the need for greater clarity in the process of the negotiations so as to bolster confidence and avoid divisions among the Members of the United Nations. In our opinion, this requires efforts during this session to achieve an agreement on the principles and rules governing reform with respect to the five key issues set out in decision 62/557 so as to ensure clarity and transparency in the negotiations before we move on to substantial matters. We must bear in mind all proposals and positions put forward by Member States regarding the expansion and reform of the Council. That must take place with the agreement of Member States and groups of States that present their proposals. We are fully confident that these very clear points will guide Ambassador Lucas in her efforts as Chair of the negotiations during the seventieth session to achieve consensus on how to move forward. The Arab Group is aware of the importance of the five key issues of Security Council reform in the context of a global vision of a solution that would enjoy majority agreement. To this end, we draw attention to the role of the General Assembly, which has many roles to play at many different levels, including making recommendations to the Security Council on matters pertaining to international peace and security, pursuant to Article 11 of the Charter of the United Nations. There is therefore a need to bear in mind the complementary relationship between the General Assembly and the Security Council so as to guarantee a balance between these two bodies. We highlight the fact that the use by the Council\\u2019s five permanent members of their right of veto has on more than one occasion eroded the Council\\u2019s credibility and paralysed its decision-making ability. It has also prevented necessary measures being taken to promote and protect international peace and security. Furthermore, the Council\\u2019s procedures and working methods must be made more efficient and transparent. The position of the members of the League of Arab States on Security Council reform is to ask for permanent Arab representation on the Council, enjoying all prerogatives when the Security Council is expanded. We would ask for proportional representation for Arab States with respect to non-permanent membership. We must not set an artificial deadline that might hamper a global solution to the question of reform. We are willing to cooperate positively on this during the seventieth session of the General Assembly. \",\n\"{'Action': 3.47425732627471e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.7507154836948757e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 1.3302741308507393e-07, 'Body': 4.2264550192960826e-10, 'Clarification': 7.216858932679315e-08, 'Conclusion': 1.1832995028271398e-08, 'Election': 3.228127098964251e-08, 'General': 0.9999986886978149, 'Introduction': 6.508572596430895e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 3.4021090389302344e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 2.0709011394615118e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 2.7794282431159445e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 9.535324352327734e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 3.110718793664091e-08, 'OralStatement': 3.5832162126325784e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.549487732039779e-08, 'RVRequested': 5.392691293515384e-10, 'RVTaken': 1.3636815010542591e-09, 'Session': 4.8429686927420335e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.5757251059511646e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 8.329760881053971e-09, 'Vote': 6.767967075660408e-09, 'VotingIntention': 1.2282932004836766e-07}\",\n[[\"Alotaibi\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Courtenay Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Jamaica\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sylvie Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Luxembourg\", \"UNPE\"], [\"More than 20 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"seventy years\", \"DATE\"], [\"decision 62/557\", \"D\"], [\"five\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"decision 62/557\", \"D\"], [\"Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"five\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"five\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"more than one\", \"CARDINAL\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 212,\n            'f': \"212\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 36,\n            'f': \"36\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999983310699463,\n            'f': \"0.9999983310699463\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Braun (Germany): I have the honour to take the floor today on behalf of the Group of Four (G-4) to convey a two-fold message of gratefulness and urgency. First, I should like to express our gratitude to you, Mr. President, for your commitment to moving the process of Security Council reform forward during your term in office. We hope there will be substantial progress during this seventieth session, based on the legacy of former Assembly President Sam Kutesa and the former Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations, Courtenay Rattray, who led a transparent, inclusive and open process. Let me express our thanks and our explicit respect to Ambassador Rattray at this point. As for your efforts during the seventieth session, Mr. President, please be assured of our full support. As expressed in the many debates and events in recent weeks, there is growing support among the Members of the United Nations for a structural reform of the Security Council. At the same time, on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary, we hear growing criticism directed at the Council for being unable to take decisions concerning some of the most pressing situations in international security. As was pointed out during the open debate in the Security Council on 20 October (see S/PV.7539), improvement of the Council\\u2019s working methods is crucial. However, it cannot be a substitute for the urgently needed structural reform of the Council. We, the G-4, along with many more Member States, are convinced that a more representative, legitimate and effective Security Council is needed more than ever in order to address the global conflicts and crises that have multiplied in recent years. We share the view that this can be achieved only by reflecting the reality of the world in the twenty-first century, when more Member States have the capacity and willingness to take on the crucial responsibility of maintaining international peace and security. Inclusiveness is the key phrase, and here I direct my view to Africa first and foremost. The roll-over decision 69/560 of 14 September stipulates that the General Assembly must immediately continue intergovernmental negotiations based on the text presented by its President at the sixty-ninth session in his letter dated 31 July 2015. That was a veritable milestone for all those in favour of a more representative, more legitimate and more effective Security Council. Nearly 120 delegations contributed actively to the framework document that will serve as the vantage point for text-based negotiations during the upcoming round of the intergovernmental negotiations. We cannot afford to lose the newly gained momentum. Leadership of the process will be crucial during the stage that lies ahead during this seventieth session. We therefore commend you, Mr. President, for having appointed Ms. Sylvie Lucas as the new Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations to steer this process leading to a resolution reflecting the results of these negotiations. We are fully confident that Ambassador Lucas will advance the process and bring it to a successful conclusion accepted by the wide majority of Members. The past session of the General Assembly was procedural in nature with respect to the intergovernmental negotiations. Based on the results achieved during that session, we expect the intergovernmental negotiations to produce progress in substance under the new Chairperson during this seventieth session. In conclusion, let me also mention that we would welcome more continuity in the Chairperson\\u2019s office to ensure the smooth continuation of the intergovernmental negotiations process and to avoid the kind of undue disruption that we have witnessed recently. \",\n\"{'Action': 5.1959354152586457e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.7138496843926987e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 1.1310889647120348e-07, 'Body': 3.2755573253773207e-10, 'Clarification': 1.2035786767228274e-07, 'Conclusion': 9.412926438301383e-09, 'Election': 3.405375181841919e-08, 'General': 0.9999983310699463, 'Introduction': 1.0509064622965525e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 7.0834516030515715e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 2.8640823046544028e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 2.393266473887934e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 1.9145026897149364e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 5.1850157944954844e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.7555668918589618e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 4.841648149067623e-08, 'RVRequested': 4.789665331017545e-10, 'RVTaken': 1.1150885770305763e-09, 'Session': 4.2318122339679576e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.4038300522045688e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.3439566792783353e-08, 'Vote': 1.90974684954881e-08, 'VotingIntention': 1.536256348799725e-07}\",\n[[\"Braun\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Germany\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Sam Kutesa\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Courtenay Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"recent weeks\", \"DATE\"], [\"20 October\", \"DATE\"], [\"recent years\", \"DATE\"], [\"the twenty-first century\", \"DATE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"decision 69/560\", \"D\"], [\"14 September\", \"DATE\"], [\"sixty-ninth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"31 July 2015\", \"DATE\"], [\"Nearly 120\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Sylvie Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Chairperson\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Chairperson\", \"PERSON\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 213,\n            'f': \"213\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 37,\n            'f': \"37\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999997615814209,\n            'f': \"0.9999997615814209\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Sauer (Finland): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Nordic countries: Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and my own country, Finland.

Let me underline that the Nordic countries will remain fully committed to Security Council reform in order to address better and more effectively the urgent global challenges of today and tomorrow. \",\n\"{'Action': 4.2996542437556684e-10, 'ActionObject': 7.623260356304229e-11, 'AgendaStatus': 1.5228428518199166e-09, 'Body': 3.269373053532698e-12, 'Clarification': 1.4779449886148655e-09, 'Conclusion': 3.0426602903865785e-10, 'Election': 3.7188503387852734e-09, 'General': 0.9999997615814209, 'Introduction': 1.820285433495883e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.4396248909930307e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 9.570765291400107e-10, 'MeetingNumber': 8.081292579564803e-11, 'MeetingSegment': 1.0221700152968083e-09, 'MeetingStatus': 8.874806445291483e-10, 'OralStatement': 4.038332862554839e-11, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.0955620854957715e-09, 'RVRequested': 1.3679487230466858e-11, 'RVTaken': 1.4169718350054428e-11, 'Session': 1.481765959931991e-10, 'Sponsorship': 4.466797071112083e-11, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.0066732437106225e-10, 'Vote': 9.751962792847735e-09, 'VotingIntention': 4.821709698177301e-09}\",\n[[\"Sauer\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Finland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Denmark\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Iceland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Norway\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sweden\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Finland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"10 years ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sylvie Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Luxembourg\", \"UNPE\"], [\"decision 69/560\", \"D\"], [\"Courtenay Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Jamaica\", \"UNPE\"], [\"ninth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"tomorrow\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 214,\n            'f': \"214\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 38,\n            'f': \"38\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999998807907104,\n            'f': \"0.9999998807907104\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Lamek (France) (spoke in French): First, I would like to welcome the appointment of Ambassador Sylvie Lucas as facilitator of the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform. We know that we can count on her dynamism and experience to make real progress towards far-reaching reform of the Council. France will fully support her to ensure that she is successful. General Assembly discussions on Security Council reform have gone on for almost two decades. We must recognize that we have not yet reached a conclusion on the matter. Nonetheless, with Ambassador Courtenay Rattray at its helm \\u2014 whose outstanding work and consultative and inclusive methods I commend \\u2014 the work undertaken during the Assembly\\u2019s sixty-ninth session produced an initial outcome that was supported by the vast majority of Member States. France hopes that the outcome of this work will serve as a basis for the next cycle of intergovernmental negotiations, to be held during this session, in line with decision 69/560, which the Assembly adopted by consensus on 14 September. We now need to start negotiating a text as soon as possible on this basis. We are counting on the new facilitator to strive to that end. The seventieth anniversary of our Organization must serve as an opportunity for Member States to finally reach agreement on far-reaching reform. This is an historic opportunity to show that the United Nations is far from being fossilized and is able to reform itself. This reform is fundamental. The Security Council must better reflect the reality of today\\u2019s world. Its reform is crucial to bolstering the prestige and representativeness of our collective security system, while preserving its executive and decision-making nature. France\\u2019s position on this issue is well known. We want the Security Council to take into consideration the emergence of new Powers that have the resolve and ability to shoulder the responsibility of a permanent presence in the Security Council and that are, in line with the Charter of the United Nations, able to make an important contribution to the work of the Council. To that end, France supports the candidacies of Germany, Brazil, India and Japan as permanent members of the Security Council, as well as a reinforced presence of African countries as permanent and non-permanent members. In the same spirit of reform, France has proposed that the five permanent members of the Security Council voluntarily and collectively suspend the use of their veto in cases of mass atrocities. This voluntary step requires no revision of the Charter but a political commitment. France has already made that commitment. The President of the Republic clearly indicated it here in this Hall on 28 September (see A/70/PV.13). This is an extremely important decision on behalf of international security, peace and relegitimized and renewed multilateralism. This initiative, which we have put forward together with Mexico, is now supported by some 85 countries. Along the same lines, the code of conduct developed by the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group, which France supports, also enjoys very considerable support. Buoyed by this we positive trend, we hope that we will be able to persuade other Member States,  in particular the other permanent members of the Council, to join with us. It is in the common interest of all Member States that the Security Council be able to carry out its mandate and play its full role, in particular when faced with situations of mass atrocities. These initiatives on the use of the right of veto are complementary to the global reform of the Council, which France will continue to advocate. It behoves us all collectively to assume our responsibilities to develop the status quo in the interests of the United Nations. \",\n\"{'Action': 6.223865423038433e-09, 'ActionObject': 3.5946432497269143e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 1.4011578564065985e-08, 'Body': 4.202960202093209e-11, 'Clarification': 1.6770975719282433e-08, 'Conclusion': 9.354607088951639e-10, 'Election': 8.488425073949202e-09, 'General': 0.9999998807907104, 'Introduction': 3.277384408306716e-08, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.1793077625554815e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 3.155028016621486e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 3.555216399053762e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 7.442799265788835e-09, 'MeetingStatus': 5.169616734690408e-09, 'OralStatement': 1.1585603587604965e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.805198073829729e-09, 'RVRequested': 3.1371190367668333e-11, 'RVTaken': 1.5482670701061352e-10, 'Session': 7.254453149307949e-10, 'Sponsorship': 5.359086507894517e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 9.74920699725601e-10, 'Vote': 1.6080040632360237e-09, 'VotingIntention': 2.1051612009159726e-08}\",\n[[\"Lamek\", \"PERSON\"], [\"France\", \"UNPE\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Sylvie Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"France\", \"UNPE\"], [\"almost two decades\", \"DATE\"], [\"Courtenay Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"sixty-ninth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"France\", \"UNPE\"], [\"decision 69/560\", \"D\"], [\"14 September\", \"DATE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"France\", \"UNPE\"], [\"France\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Germany\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Brazil\", \"UNPE\"], [\"India\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Japan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"France\", \"UNPE\"], [\"five\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Charter\", \"PERSON\"], [\"France\", \"UNPE\"], [\"28 September\", \"DATE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Mexico\", \"UNPE\"], [\"some 85\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"France\", \"UNPE\"], [\"France\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 215,\n            'f': \"215\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 39,\n            'f': \"39\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 1.0,\n            'f': \"1.0\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): I thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to offer some brief remarks on the topic of Security Council reform this year. First, I should like to thank Ambassador Rattray, who has steered the work in the intergovernmental negotiations in a skilful and effective way for the past year. He has shown the resolve and courage necessary to make even one step forward towards a real process of negotiation, in which we still do not find ourselves after several years. If we ever get to that point, Ambassador Rattray will have made a very important contribution to that. Secondly, I should like to thank Ambassador Lucas for taking on this role for the next session. We cannot think of a better person to lead the negotiations on Security Council reform for the future, and we pledge our full support to her. We have noted with concern over the past year the strong resistance among a small number of Members to any real progress in the intergovernmental negotiations, even though the process we were engaged in was fully transparent. We also note with concern the pressure exercised on the Chair in this respect, even though he led the work of the intergovernmental negotiations in a flawless manner. If that trend were to continue, we would probably have to question our ability and willingness to engage in these negotiations and consider alternative formats. It is our hope that this session will allow us, under the leadership of Ambassador Lucas, to focus on the substance of the issues under the strong leadership of the Chair, as is customary in this building. As is well known, in our national capacity we made an expansion proposal a number of years ago. Liechtenstein proposed the creation of a new category of seats that would be long-term \\u2014 for example, 10 years \\u2014 and immediately renewable and would thereby allow States to serve permanently on the Security Council if the membership mandated them to do so. The proposal obviously would not lead to the creation of any new veto rights and would be subject to a mandatory review of all aspects of Security Council reform after a defined period of time. It is well known that my delegation is very strongly committed to the improvement of the working methods of the Security Council. We believe that this is an indispensable part of Security Council reform. There are obvious changes that would need to be made in the Council\\u2019s working methods if and when it is enlarged under any enlargement model. Very obvious areas are the majority required for adoption of a resolution in the Council, as well as the Council presidency and its distribution in such a way that each State gets to serve in this capacity at least once during its Security Council term. In the meantime, as has been the case over the past 20 years, we look to the Security Council to change its working methods in its current composition. It is against that background that we were very happy on Friday to launch the code of conduct on voting in the Security Council on behalf of the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group. The code of conduct, now supported by 106 States, is a pledge to take meaningful action in the Security Council to end and prevent atrocity crimes and to not vote against any meaningful, credible proposals submitted to that end. We are very grateful to all States that have pledged their support for the code of conduct. We ask all States to equally give their support to the political declaration proposed by France and we look forward to have additional States joining the code of conduct. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.0626415303249814e-09, 'ActionObject': 3.961806160912573e-10, 'AgendaStatus': 2.1353365742271535e-09, 'Body': 4.6040007743719524e-12, 'Clarification': 2.8099591542485314e-09, 'Conclusion': 9.609393836207403e-11, 'Election': 3.3083968897784644e-09, 'General': 1.0, 'Introduction': 9.815711798921711e-09, 'MeetingDateTime': 3.741809084800707e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 6.921245798707787e-10, 'MeetingNumber': 6.901481469645532e-11, 'MeetingSegment': 7.166929272273137e-10, 'MeetingStatus': 1.3190173397958915e-09, 'OralStatement': 9.136044143431832e-10, 'PresidingOfficer': 5.01815589082355e-10, 'RVRequested': 3.814128700374564e-12, 'RVTaken': 1.49382589631486e-11, 'Session': 1.4928129565827675e-10, 'Sponsorship': 6.577668965057626e-11, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.6254694812367632e-10, 'Vote': 9.685986457341755e-10, 'VotingIntention': 2.9094489040204508e-09}\",\n[[\"Wenaweser\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Liechtenstein\", \"UNPE\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the past year\", \"DATE\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"several years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Secondly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the past year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"a number of years ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"Liechtenstein\", \"UNPE\"], [\"10 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"past 20\", \"PARA\"], [\"Friday\", \"DATE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"106\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"France\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 216,\n            'f': \"216\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 40,\n            'f': \"40\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999986886978149,\n            'f': \"0.9999986886978149\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): The Chinese delegation thanks you, Mr. President, for convening today\\u2019s meeting.

We encourage her to be objective and fair in her work, in accordance with the mandate of resolution 62/557, to build bridges among Member States, and to help all Member States to narrow their differences and make compromises on the issue of Council reform. Security Council reform bears on the common interests of all Member States and the long-term interests of the United Nations. China has always actively supported reasonable and necessary reform of the Council aimed at enhancing its efficiency and authority, increasing the representation of and giving a stronger voice to the developing countries, especially African countries, and affording more opportunities to more countries, especially the small and medium- sized countries that account for the majority of the membership to participate in the decisions of the Security Council and play a greater role. In accordance with decision 62/557 and the consensus of Member States, the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform should be led by the Member States. China hopes that the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform at the current session of the General Assembly will turn over a new page, return to the correct, membership-driven track, and build on the positions taken, the proposals and suggestions put forward and the efforts made by all countries since the launch of the negotiations in 2009. We hope that Member States will continue to participate constructively in the intergovernmental negotiations, seek a package solution through extensive and democratic consultations, and reach the broadest possible consensus. No artificial deadline should be set for reform, and no immature reform proposals should be forcibly promoted. China would like to work jointly with all countries to advance Council reform in a direction that conforms to the common interests of all Member States and the long-term interests of the United Nations. \",\n\"{'Action': 2.5880856568960553e-08, 'ActionObject': 3.965237382885789e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 5.764096044913458e-08, 'Body': 6.060160151477589e-10, 'Clarification': 8.195604550564894e-08, 'Conclusion': 8.6708205060404e-09, 'Election': 2.5748754239884875e-08, 'General': 0.9999986886978149, 'Introduction': 4.94913365400862e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 7.778613309028515e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 2.245944408230116e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 3.5844240908744496e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 2.786900097362377e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 1.2026490914252008e-08, 'OralStatement': 6.662993001782525e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.1570906011115767e-08, 'RVRequested': 3.905537837578521e-10, 'RVTaken': 1.6993350060445778e-09, 'Session': 3.51046547386602e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.4607923759513142e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.1742424749504607e-08, 'Vote': 8.848180854670318e-09, 'VotingIntention': 2.5768468958631274e-07}\",\n[[\"Liu Jieyi\", \"PERSON\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Luxembourg\", \"UNPE\"], [\"resolution 62/557\", \"R\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"decision 62/557\", \"D\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2009\", \"DATE\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 217,\n            'f': \"217\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 41,\n            'f': \"41\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999998807907104,\n            'f': \"0.9999998807907104\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Bamrungphong (Thailand): As we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations this year, it is a good opportunity to remind ourselves that the United Nations can only be as strong and as effective as Member States want and make it to be. The reform of the Security Council is no exception. It can be possible only if Member States are willing to be more flexible and are prepared to engage in negotiations that are constructive, pragmatic and results-oriented. The decision made at the last round of the intergovernmental negotiations was a significant step in our collective efforts. The process leading up to it provided us with an opportunity to exchange views in an interactive, inclusive and transparent manner. I take this opportunity to express our appreciation to Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, Permanent Representative of Jamaica, for his hard work and dedication throughout the last round of the intergovernmental negotiations. We also welcome the appointment of Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, as the next Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations and wish her success in this very important responsibility. In this regard, allow me to share the following views in this debate. First, Thailand belongs to no specific group and has always been open to all ideas and proposals on the expansion of membership of the Security Council, including the expansion of both categories or the introduction of interim or intermediate options. However, settling only the issue of expansion of membership is far from adequate if the overall reform process is to be successful. Any expansion must take into account a greater and more equitable regional representation. Most importantly, it must prove to be useful in enhancing the Council\\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness. Secondly, Thailand firmly believes that improvement in the working methods of the Security Council is necessary for a more transparent and effective Council. Improving the working methods should be a continuing process and should not be held hostage to the overall reform of the Council. We welcome the Council\\u2019s ongoing efforts to convene open debates and engage in informative discussions on this subject. On this note, we also welcome the ongoing efforts to strengthen the closer coordination and collaboration between the Council and the General Assembly, two principal organs of the United Nations, in accordance with their respective mandates, through the institutionalization of regular consultations between the Presidents of the two bodies. Interaction helps to ensure transparency in the deliberations of the Council. Thailand believes that the Council can be transparent only if it is accessible. In this regard, we urge members of the Council to continue to engage the wider membership of the United Nations, particularly on issues with broader impact and complexity. Thirdly, we firmly believe that the principle of accountability should guide the work of the Council\\u2019s members, permanent and elected alike. The world needs a Council that can act together in a decisive, responsible and timely manner to stop genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes. Countries on the Security Council, especially the permanent members, have a heavy responsibility to humankind. They must therefore demonstrate greater leadership and political will to take decisive action against such vast scale humanitarian catastrophes resulting from conflicts. For this reason, Thailand supports the two initiatives that are on the table: the suspension of the veto in case of mass atrocities, put forward by France and Mexico, and the code of conduct regarding Security Council action against genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, put forward by the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group. We have come a long way since 1946, when there were only 11 members on the Security Council. We must take this opportunity to ensure that the important work of the intergovernmental negotiations continues by building on the work done at the last session in a consultative manner, while aiming at taking on board the broadest participation possible. We look forward to participating in a constructive, substantive discussion on the way forward for greater representation on and greater  credibility, legitimacy and, above all, effectiveness of the Security Council, and in the hope of seeing a clearer basis for the future progress of our work. \",\n\"{'Action': 5.3574029656999755e-09, 'ActionObject': 2.324983539025993e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 2.2415648004425748e-08, 'Body': 6.315387102162617e-11, 'Clarification': 2.447363733892871e-08, 'Conclusion': 3.2920051129536887e-09, 'Election': 8.662219386224024e-09, 'General': 0.9999998807907104, 'Introduction': 1.176000310465497e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.867777488229194e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 7.65621521736648e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 6.407310793044019e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 9.997670247230417e-09, 'MeetingStatus': 8.097857495670269e-09, 'OralStatement': 1.1001590749515344e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 5.281259429779084e-09, 'RVRequested': 7.343856772701329e-11, 'RVTaken': 2.844685875746933e-10, 'Session': 1.235689439660348e-09, 'Sponsorship': 9.732838979203962e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.7016789088941664e-09, 'Vote': 5.96284843723538e-09, 'VotingIntention': 5.7404150766160456e-08}\",\n[[\"Bamrungphong\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Thailand\", \"UNPE\"], [\"this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Courtenay Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Jamaica\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sylvie Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Luxembourg\", \"UNPE\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Thailand\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Secondly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Thailand\", \"UNPE\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Thailand\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Thirdly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Thailand\", \"UNPE\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"France\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Mexico\", \"UNPE\"], [\"1946\", \"DATE\"], [\"only 11\", \"CARDINAL\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 218,\n            'f': \"218\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 42,\n            'f': \"42\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.999998927116394,\n            'f': \"0.999998927116394\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The time has undoubtedly come for Security Council reform.

We thank the Permanent Representative Courtenay Rattray of Jamaica for his work in that post at the previous session of the General Assembly. We also wish to highlight the work of the former Permanent Representative of Afghanistan Zahir Tanin in that job over many years. Russia recognizes the need to make the Security Council more representative. However, efforts in this area should not have an impact on the Council\\u2019s ability to react swiftly and effectively to contemporary challenges. In this context, we are in favour of retaining the  compact character of the Council\\u2019s composition. The optimal number of members of the Security Council should not exceed 20. That would guarantee for non-permanent members an opportunityto preside over the Council. It would be na\\u00efve to claim that the reformed and expanded Council would easily find solutions to the problems that the present Council has failed to address. Political contradictions would not simply disappear, while the work on the texts of decisions would only be further complicated. We are not going to hide the fact that any idea tending to undermine the existing prerogatives of the permanent members, including the right of veto, is unacceptable to us. We recall that this right is an important factor that helps members of the Council to strike balanced decisions. It is also important to understand that the right of veto protects not only the interests of those who enjoy it, but also the interests of the countries of a region that do not have the right of veto but in its absence would be vulnerable to pressure from well-known groups of States. During 11 rounds of intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform, Member States have managed to achieve something. Many aspects of the problem have become clearer. However, a universal decision that would be satisfactory to everybody has not yet appeared. We fully support the idea that the process of Security Council reform should be owned by every single Member State and that its final outcome should be supported as broadly as possible by Members of the Organization. We are convinced that Security Council reform cannot be concluded arithmetically by calculating different models of votes in order to seek the minimal number of votes. A result achieved that way would undoubtedly undermine the authority of the Council and would not strengthen the United Nations. Rather, it would do the opposite. We are therefore prepared to consider any sensible option for expanding the Council, including interim provisions and compromise solutions, if it were to enjoy the broadest possible support within the United Nations. Furthermore, the negotiations have revealed the prevalence of sometimes diametrically opposed opinions. We therefore see no alternative at this session of the General Assembly than to work carefully to bring positions closer together. We trust that the efforts of the President of the General Assembly and the negotiations facilitator will help to achieve optimal agreement in the negotiations, on the understanding that the ownership of the process remains with the Member States. This work should take place in a calm, transparent and inclusive environment without arbitrarily imposed deadlines or frenzied speculation. The matter of reforming any institution, let alone the most important, should not complicate the real work of our Organization, finding responses to the numerous challenges facing humanity today. Let us not forget the most important thing. Progress in reforming the Security Council depends on the political resolve and readiness of Member States to find a sensible compromise, and on that alone. In that regard. methodology is a secondary issue. \",\n\"{'Action': 5.05926927019118e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.8780328403522617e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 1.1096800278664887e-07, 'Body': 3.969456707775265e-10, 'Clarification': 1.606868380576998e-07, 'Conclusion': 9.707897596911153e-09, 'Election': 1.9225799618993733e-08, 'General': 0.999998927116394, 'Introduction': 7.241141020131181e-08, 'MeetingDateTime': 5.142233305832633e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 2.268128440618966e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 1.957498385607437e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 2.810584831536289e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 4.3106005875870324e-08, 'OralStatement': 3.1200499961414607e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.4329057879413085e-08, 'RVRequested': 1.6378851053211463e-10, 'RVTaken': 1.7159006437950097e-09, 'Session': 4.940947206932833e-09, 'Sponsorship': 4.007946863282541e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 6.499921045843848e-09, 'Vote': 3.382401914109323e-09, 'VotingIntention': 1.91108100011661e-07}\",\n[[\"Churkin\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Russian Federation\", \"UNPE\"], [\"as a whole\", \"DR_MOD\"], [\"Luxembourg\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Courtenay Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Jamaica\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Afghanistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Zahir Tanin\", \"PERSON\"], [\"many years\", \"DATE\"], [\"20\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"11\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 219,\n            'f': \"219\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 43,\n            'f': \"43\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999985694885254,\n            'f': \"0.9999985694885254\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Mukerji (India): My delegation aligns itself with the statements made earlier by the Permanent Representative of Saint Lucia on behalf of the L.69 group and the Permanent Representative of Germany on behalf of the Group of Four. At the outset, allow me to compliment you, Mr. President, on convening this important debate under agenda item 121, which has been a matter of discussion in the General Assembly for more than two decades, and ever since my country joined other developing countries in September 1992 in submitting resolution 47/62. We note the significance of decision 69/560, of 14 September 2015, which was adopted unanimously under the presidency of your predecessor, Mr. Sam Kutesa. That has given us a negotiating text for implementing the mandate our leaders adopted at the World Summit of 2005 for early reforms of the Security Council. We would like to acknowledge and compliment Ambassador Courtenay Rattray of Jamaica for having successfully given our intergovernmental negotiations process the negotiating text of 31 July. We are happy, Sir, to have received your letter of 23 October informing us of your decision to appoint a new chairperson for these negotiations during this historic seventieth session and for providing her with a clear mandate to conduct these negotiations on the basis of the text of 31 July, which was, we note, unanimously endorsed in decision 69/560. We are happy to share with the General Assembly the common position adopted yesterday at the third India-Africa Forum Summit for early implementation of decision 69/560 so as to make a decisive push for achieving concrete outcomes on the reforms of the Security Council. We commit ourselves at this meeting \\u2014 which is the first time we are speaking on this issue at this session \\u2014 to work in good faith through the give and take of negotiations with the Chairperson to reach our common objective of concrete outcomes during this session of the General Assembly. We especially look forward to engaging with Member States that have expressed important views this morning but have yet to contribute to the 31 July text in this context. We would of course expect to apply the provisions of resolution 53/30, of 23 November 1998, which we unanimously adopted and which sets a benchmark of a two thirds majority for taking decisions on this important issue. We note that an ineffective Security Council has entailed huge human, economic and environmental costs in terms of wars and conflicts, which the international community cannot justify any longer. The figures speak for themselves, but today we would like to highlight especially the more than 60 million people affected by these conflicts, which are due to the malfunctioning of the Security Council. Given that most of these conflicts are occurring in areas consisting of  developing countries, we believe that a greater representation of developing countries in both categories of an expanded Security Council would help to address this problem urgently. We would emphasize that our work cannot be seen in isolation. The very fact that our leaders unanimously adopted the most ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) to eradicate poverty from the face of the Earth within our generation gives our work a context and framework. The longer we delay in reforming the Security Council, the more pressure we put on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, especially for developing countries. We have two specific requests related to the process to make for consideration today. First, we would request the announcement of a fixed schedule of meetings of the intergovernmental negotiations, beginning from early next month, at a regular interval, to commence text-based negotiations. All Member States should be informed in advance of the frequency, agenda and schedule of these meetings. They should be, in our view, held at least once a week, given the urgency of the subject. Secondly, we look forward to the circulation of a communication, under your authority, Mr. President, from the newly appointed Chairperson of the intergovernmental negotiations, conveying the agenda of each of these sessions of the seventieth session, which would of course be based on the decision taken by the General Assembly earlier on the five clusters. This will help delegations obtain their updated negotiating mandates for the listed areas of negotiations in good time. In conclusion, I should like to reiterate what my Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi, said in his statement to this Assembly last month: \\u201cWe must also reform the United Nations, including the Security Council. That is essential if we are to ensure that our institutions have greater credibility and legitimacy. With a more broad- based representation, we can be more effective in achieving our goals.\\u201d (A/70/PV.4, p. 18) \",\n\"{'Action': 1.1652024056729715e-07, 'ActionObject': 1.7077480762850428e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 2.025724938903295e-07, 'Body': 7.890034736668383e-10, 'Clarification': 1.2536588656075764e-07, 'Conclusion': 9.13188902273987e-09, 'Election': 1.0096697877770566e-07, 'General': 0.9999985694885254, 'Introduction': 1.7756931924850505e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.710691854839297e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 6.541175423535606e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 7.2158492514518e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 1.248184275937092e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 9.215214902269508e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.6971517879937892e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.126749348325575e-08, 'RVRequested': 3.722867847333333e-10, 'RVTaken': 2.7784738954039767e-09, 'Session': 1.3399461096241794e-08, 'Sponsorship': 4.74677896988851e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.5655759355581722e-08, 'Vote': 2.0195976446757413e-08, 'VotingIntention': 2.0290563895741798e-07}\",\n[[\"Mukerji\", \"PERSON\"], [\"India\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Saint Lucia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Germany\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"agenda item 121\", \"AI\"], [\"more than two decades\", \"DATE\"], [\"September 1992\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolution 47/62\", \"R\"], [\"decision 69/560\", \"D\"], [\"14 September 2015\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sam Kutesa\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Courtenay Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Jamaica\", \"UNPE\"], [\"31 July\", \"DATE\"], [\"23 October\", \"DATE\"], [\"31 July\", \"DATE\"], [\"decision 69/560\", \"D\"], [\"yesterday\", \"DATE\"], [\"third\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"decision 69/560\", \"D\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Chairperson\", \"PERSON\"], [\"this morning\", \"TIME\"], [\"31 July\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolution 53/30\", \"R\"], [\"23\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"November 1998\", \"DATE\"], [\"two thirds\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"more than 60 million\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2030\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"resolution 70/1\", \"R\"], [\"2030\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"early next month\", \"DATE\"], [\"Secondly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Chairperson\", \"PERSON\"], [\"five\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Narendra Modi\", \"PERSON\"], [\"last month\", \"DATE\"], [\"p. 18\", \"PARA\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 220,\n            'f': \"220\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 44,\n            'f': \"44\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999998807907104,\n            'f': \"0.9999998807907104\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Wilson (United Kingdom): I pay tribute to the work of your predecessor, Mr. President, and that of Ambassador Rattray over the past year. They brought much-needed energy and innovation to a debate which has been dormant for too long. We know that you and Ambassador Lucas will approach reform of the Security Council with the same vigour. You can count on the support of the United Kingdom in your efforts, and I encourage all Member States to join us and give you their backing. As my Foreign Secretary made clear when he addressed the General Assembly in September (see A/70/PV.18), the United Nations needs a reformed Security Council. Earlier this week, we celebrated the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. In this milestone year, we owe it to ourselves to make much- needed progress in reforming the Security Council. We need a Council which is representative of today\\u2019s world and able to respond effectively to the challenges that we face. The compilation text compiled by Ambassador Rattray is a good start, and we look forward to building on that work in the year ahead. The United Kingdom\\u2019s own position on Security Council reform is clear. We support permanent representation for Brazil, India, Germany and Japan and permanent African representation. When considering the overall size of a reformed Council we must not reduce the Council\\u2019s ability to act decisively when called upon to address threats to international peace and security. The United Kingdom will continue to advocate for reform from within the Security Council so that it remains fit for purpose in the twenty-first century. We are proud to have been the first permanent member of the Council to sign up to the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group\\u2019s code of conduct for the Security Council. In doing so, we have sent a clear message: the United Kingdom will never vote against a credible Security Council draft resolution that seeks to prevent or respond to genocide, ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity and war crimes. I hope all Security Council members, both present and future, will join us in making that pledge. Next week the United Kingdom will assume the presidency of the Security Council. We will discharge our responsibilities in a transparent and efficient manner so that Council meetings are as open, interactive and effective as possible. We will be ready to respond quickly to emerging or developing situations so that the Council is, and is seen to be, discharging its responsibilities efficiently and effectively. I wish you, Sir, and Ambassador Lucas and all of us every success in the year ahead. \",\n\"{'Action': 3.709228479920057e-10, 'ActionObject': 2.92146445923791e-10, 'AgendaStatus': 2.5746413889748965e-09, 'Body': 3.0193252412158422e-12, 'Clarification': 1.447375552743324e-09, 'Conclusion': 1.9489190816734947e-10, 'Election': 3.6936209646398765e-09, 'General': 0.9999998807907104, 'Introduction': 1.378091809556281e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.4795464853278872e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 4.193633496019089e-10, 'MeetingNumber': 7.262231094262717e-11, 'MeetingSegment': 1.0079171941512755e-09, 'MeetingStatus': 7.517855782346317e-10, 'OralStatement': 4.333317385474267e-11, 'PresidingOfficer': 8.710193677430311e-10, 'RVRequested': 1.9412721430356328e-11, 'RVTaken': 9.616136012469134e-12, 'Session': 1.00076558151585e-10, 'Sponsorship': 1.5003533138102654e-11, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.1014344991622238e-10, 'Vote': 2.080467575993339e-09, 'VotingIntention': 1.8115140498764504e-09}\",\n[[\"Wilson\", \"PERSON\"], [\"United Kingdom\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the past year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"United Kingdom\", \"UNPE\"], [\"September\", \"DATE\"], [\"Earlier this week\", \"DATE\"], [\"this milestone year\", \"DATE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the year ahead\", \"DATE\"], [\"United Kingdom\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Brazil\", \"UNPE\"], [\"India\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Germany\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Japan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"United Kingdom\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the twenty-first century\", \"DATE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"United Kingdom\", \"UNPE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"Next week\", \"DATE\"], [\"United Kingdom\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the year ahead\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 221,\n            'f': \"221\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 45,\n            'f': \"45\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 1.0,\n            'f': \"1.0\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Sison (United States of America): It is indeed appropriate for us to meet early in this new session of the General Assembly to discuss the important issue of Security Council reform. My delegation welcomes the chance to continue this essential discussion with the membership. We warmly welcome the appointment of Ambassador Sylvie Lucas as Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations. We also wish to thank Ambassador Courtenay Rattray for his strong leadership during his tenure. I hope that you, Mr. President, and the Chair, as well as the wider membership here today, know that the United States is committed to working with other Members to achieve broad consensus on a reformed Council, a Council that reflects the realities of the twenty-first century. As we have said before, the United States is open to a modest expansion, in principle, in both permanent and non-permanent members of the Security Council. We do not support changes to the veto. We consider the intergovernmental negotiations to be the best forum for advancing discussion on Security Council reform. We believe that any approach to this issue should enhance the Council\\u2019s effectiveness and efficiency in carrying out the responsibilities conferred upon it under the Charter of the United Nations. Council membership carries great responsibility. Thus we believe that any consideration of an expansion of permanent members must take into account the ability and willingness of countries to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security and to other purposes of the United Nations. We look to engage with fellow Member States on an intergovernmental negotiations process that is deliberate and inclusive, given the importance of Security Council reform, the complexity of the issues and the divergence of views among Member States. For any reform to be successful, it is crucial that proposals enjoy broad support among all Member States. We note that some Member States have called for the start of text-based negotiations. The United States is neutral on all manner of negotiation within the intergovernmental negotiations framework as long as it furthers the broad consensus that is needed to reach comprehensive international agreement on Council reform. We are cognizant of the fact that differences of opinion remain on the text on which negotiations would be based and that not all Member States have endorsed a common approach. The intergovernmental negotiations Chair can certainly help steer this process, but general agreement on a common approach is crucial. We believe the intergovernmental negotiations to be the best forum for finding a comprehensive solution that can generate the broadest support among Member States. We pledge our support to Ambassador Lucas and to all Member States that seek constructive engagement on Council reform. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.2635558155338344e-09, 'ActionObject': 1.5493875071825869e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 7.247543454269589e-09, 'Body': 7.43497104160884e-12, 'Clarification': 1.1810844746662497e-08, 'Conclusion': 4.487046290080343e-10, 'Election': 8.357968761529833e-10, 'General': 1.0, 'Introduction': 9.430787706321553e-09, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.847083597183996e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 6.054714507541803e-10, 'MeetingNumber': 5.157911250885938e-11, 'MeetingSegment': 3.8406541835733776e-10, 'MeetingStatus': 2.127462206402697e-09, 'OralStatement': 6.295513887977222e-09, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.6560823823397186e-09, 'RVRequested': 6.721178301416497e-12, 'RVTaken': 2.930599166117709e-11, 'Session': 9.927202115900258e-11, 'Sponsorship': 5.85869755487245e-11, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.293620627285108e-10, 'Vote': 1.4990185481789098e-10, 'VotingIntention': 6.745230152205295e-09}\",\n[[\"Sison\", \"PERSON\"], [\"United States of America\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sylvie Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Courtenay Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the twenty-first century\", \"DATE\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the Charter of the United Nations\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Lucas\", \"PERSON\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 222,\n            'f': \"222\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 46,\n            'f': \"46\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999984502792358,\n            'f': \"0.9999984502792358\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Bodini (San Marino): I want to congratulate you, Mr. President, on the appointment of Ambassador Lucas as Chair of the Security Council reform intergovernmental negotiations. I take this opportunity to thank Ambassador Rattray for last year\\u2019s contribution to this process. I am happy Ambassador Lucas, Permanent Representative of a small State, has been selected for this important task. As is known, small States like San Marino rely heavily on the United Nations and its values. One of our greatest privileges is the right to vote, in particular for the elected members of the Security Council. The Council, at the core of the United Nations system, needs to become more democratic, accountable and efficient. That is why San Marino seeks an enlarged \\u2014with elected members only \\u2014 and geographically balanced Council. I am sure that under Ambassador Lucas\\u2019s stewardship the Council reform process will be predictable and transparent and involve great interaction among the Member States. I hope that at the end of this new round of negotiations we will reach a compromise solution among all Member States, from the five permanent members to a small country like ours. I am afraid that there will be a terrible mistake if this attempt brings us to a divisive vote. An issue of this importance needs to find a solution with the consensus of a very large majority. This process requires standard diplomatic skills.

My delegation would also like to congratulate Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, on her appointment as Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations at the seventieth session. My delegation notes that over the years, including at the previous session of the General Assembly, Member States continued to reaffirm their common desire and aspiration for reforming the Security Council to make it more inclusive, representative, legitimate, accountable and effective. Yet strong divergence persists on how to achieve the reform, and that has meant that this process has hardly made meaningful progress up to today. Recently, during the high-level segment of thof the General Assembly, the majority of leaders reiterated their call for Security Council reform. My delegation believes that to be testament to a growing, urgent need for the Assembly to pursue tangible results in this regard. My delegation recognizes that some aspects of Security Council reform are being addressed in parallel to and outside the intergovernmental negotiations process. Just recently, more than 100 countries \\u2014 the majority of the entire membership of the United Nations \\u2014 joined ranks to propose a code of conduct aimed at limiting the use of the veto and preventing the Council\\u2019s inaction, and at making it more effective in the face of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Similarly, no fewer than 80 countries have extended their support to a political declaration with a similar purpose, namely, to restrain the veto in situations of mass atrocities. In the same vein, a step forward was recently taken in pushing the Security Council to increase closer cooperation with the General Assembly, in particular in the process of the selection and appointment of the next Secretary-General. My delegation is indeed encouraged by this positive development. In the light of those current developments on the issue at hand, my delegation is of the view that there are pertinent lessons that can be drawn from, and can serve as a catalyst for, our common undertaking in the Security Council reform process. First, political commitment at the highest level from Member States is important to sustain and further advance this process. This process should also continue to be motivated and inspired by the expression of commitment and determination made in various forums outside the United Nations. Secondly, progress can be made in an incremental manner, as attested to on issues such as the use of the veto right. The same approach can also be applied to pursue progress on other aspects of Security Council reform, including on the issue of membership expansion, categories and size. While recognizing the validity of different arguments and positions for pursuing expansion in the membership of the Council, my delegation maintains its view that an incremental approach is the most feasible way to make progress on the issue. A number of countries have proposed models for membership expansion. Along with other reform issues, my delegation is willing to explore them with an open mind in the coming sessions. My delegation believes that this is in accordance with what our leaders called for more than 10 years ago, an early and comprehensive reform of the Council that can be concretely achieved by enlarging the Council with new elected members, and addressing the issue of balance and equitable representation of different regional groups. Thirdly, different tracks should be maintained and pursued in a synergized manner while at the same time ensuring that the intergovernmental negotiations process remains the main deliberative mechanism on the issue of Security Council reform. My delegation values the various ideas and initiatives that have been developed by Member States in order to make progress on specific aspects of Security Council reform, and is ready to continue its engagement in a constructive manner. My delegation also puts great emphasis on efforts to improve the working methods of the Council with the purpose of enhancing its effectiveness, efficiency and accountability. In that connection, my delegation highly values the recent Security Council open debate on working methods (see S/PV.7539). To ensure that the Security Council is fully enabled to perform its responsibilities \\u2014 and its actions are owned by the wider Member States \\u2014 my delegation believes that robust cooperation, communication, and genuine consultation with and support from all Member States are crucial. Lastly, my delegation reaffirms its view that the issue of Security Council reform is not an isolated agenda. Instead, it is linked with other United Nations reform agendas, in particular the revitalization of the General Assembly. The outcome of this reform will have great impact on the continued relevance and legitimacy of the United Nations in general before the global community. A number of unresolved conflicts and tensions in some parts of the world signify its shortcomings, which further undermines its recognized competence. Palestine and Syria are two glaring cases where a persistent lack of action by the Council has worsened the conditions of the people and made the conflicts more intractable. It is my delegation\\u2019s firm belief that we are now at a critical juncture where we have to act and mobilize a stronger common purpose for real change in the Council. \",\n\"{'Action': 3.882779875397091e-09, 'ActionObject': 4.014382992689747e-10, 'AgendaStatus': 6.903213112252615e-09, 'Body': 2.0750285170678673e-11, 'Clarification': 9.990865912357094e-09, 'Conclusion': 5.143020453957092e-10, 'Election': 4.547705323432183e-09, 'General': 1.0, 'Introduction': 1.889568501667327e-08, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.0096836700057565e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 4.665098085609998e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 2.548020405779283e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 3.284504890288531e-09, 'MeetingStatus': 5.077524178886961e-09, 'OralStatement': 6.705489941083442e-09, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.150020383950846e-09, 'RVRequested': 1.0372901322608374e-11, 'RVTaken': 9.607836748415366e-11, 'Session': 6.108187289299849e-10, 'Sponsorship': 3.2508842839895635e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 6.046693701300399e-10, 'Vote': 3.1352382912075427e-09, 'VotingIntention': 2.3154392181368166e-08}\",\n[[\"Percaya\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sylvie Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Luxembourg\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the years\", \"DATE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"more than 100\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"no fewer than 80\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Secondly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"more than 10 years ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"Thirdly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 224,\n            'f': \"224\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 48,\n            'f': \"48\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 1.0,\n            'f': \"1.0\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Lodhi (Pakistan): Let me, at the outset, say how pleased my delegation is to see you, Mr. President, presiding over the General Assembly during this landmark seventieth year of the United Nations. You can count on my country\\u2019s support in fulfilling your responsibilities. Pakistan fully associates itself with the statement delivered earlier by the representative of Italy on behalf of the Uniting for Consensus group. I would also like to congratulate Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, on her appointment as the new Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations. Pakistan assures her of its full cooperation. Assembly decision 62/557 provides the mandate for the intergovernmental negotiations process. The goal set was to achieve comprehensive reform of the Security Council on five equally important and interlinked issues and to seek a solution that could enjoy the widest possible political acceptance. Success has eluded us thus far because the focus has been on looking for procedural shortcuts rather than on genuine efforts to bridge divergent positions on substance. We can all agree that compromise and flexibility are the keys to successful outcomes in multilateral negotiations. In evaluating the lack of progress on Security Council reform, we have to acknowledge that the absence of flexibility and compromise is at the root of the impasse we face today. A few countries have sought to promote their self- arrogated right to a privileged and unequal status, and they have maintained that rigid position since the process began, about two decades ago. It is that rigidity that is the real reason for our persistent failure to achieve a more democratic, accountable, transparent and effective Security Council. For its part, the Uniting for Consensus group twice revised its proposal, and it remains ready to engage in further dialogue. There is now a great deal of history to these negotiations. But those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it. Two important lessons should be kept in mind. First, quick fixes and procedural manoeuvres have always come to nought, and secondly, no agreements are to be found at the extreme ends of political positions. An honest appraisal of those facts will mark the first meaningful step towards reform of the Security Council. The intergovernmental negotiations are a membership-driven process. The basis is the proposals and positions of Member States and negotiating groups. This process needs to be facilitated in good faith and in an open, transparent, predictable and inclusive manner, thus creating an environment that preserves mutual respect among Member States. Let me outline the basic precepts of our position on the substance of Security Council reform. Pakistan opposes the creation of new permanent seats, as it is contrary to the universally agreed principles of our time \\u2014 democracy, accountability and transparency. The Security Council needs to be expanded in the category of elected seats, allowing more representation from Member States. This has become necessary in view of the increase in United Nations membership since the Council was last expanded, five decades ago. Our goal is the democratization of the Council through a reform that promotes the interests and aspirations of all Member States \\u2014 small, medium- sized and large. Additional elected members in the Council will also have a positive impact on the Council\\u2019s accountability, transparency and working methods. More elected members will enhance regional representation and ownership, rendering the Council more legitimate. It is often said that the Security Council needs to be adapted to the realities of the twenty-first century to enhance the Council\\u2019s legitimacy and representativeness. We agree, but some countries ignore what the objective realities really are. They focus only on their narrow and contentious interpretation of political realities. That, if I may say so, is an illusion, and there are strong arguments against such an approach. First, States making that claim must know that many medium-sized States compete with them in any criteria of qualification, and may even surpass or outpace them in the future. Secondly, there is no evidence to support the argument that more permanent seats will enhance the legitimacy of the Council. To argue that more permanent seats will enhance the representativeness of the Council is disingenuous for reasons I have already cited. Thirdly, we need to carefully and soberly think whether permanence is a solution to present-day political realities that are themselves transient. If the past has changed into the present, will the present not be sure to change into the future? Will we then be looking to continuously add more permanent members to the Security Council? Fourthly, and most important, the objective realities are in fact quite different. It is a fact that United Nations membership has increased almost fourfold since its inception. It is a fact that more than one third of the United Nations membership has never had an opportunity to serve on the Council. It is also a fact that all Member States want the Council to be more democratic and accountable. But more permanent seats are the antithesis of all those objective realities. Pakistan distinguishes between the demands motivated by selfish ambitions and the collective demand of an entire continent. In that regard, we have always respected and continue to respect the African Common Position. Let me reiterate that only flexibility and compromise will take us closer to our goal. Fixed positions will stall and hobble our efforts. Had there been flexibility on the part of the delegations that have unjustifiably insisted on securing permanent seats, many Member States would already have played a positive role in the Security Council. Together we would have contributed to international peace and security. A week ago we celebrated the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. The celebration was essentially and fundamentally about the Charter of the United Nations, which we all subscribe to and which lays strong emphasis on democracy and accountability. We all pledged to respect and to promote it. We hope that this pledge will translate into action and will yield progress towards a reform of the Security Council that is rooted in the principles enshrined in the Charter. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.874279842439819e-09, 'ActionObject': 4.5346679189428585e-10, 'AgendaStatus': 4.90588814017201e-09, 'Body': 7.306214661051413e-12, 'Clarification': 6.20577722543203e-09, 'Conclusion': 2.791991082773393e-10, 'Election': 3.3354137229935077e-09, 'General': 1.0, 'Introduction': 3.8549103464902146e-08, 'MeetingDateTime': 4.701253830674545e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 1.425692008893975e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 1.1106132680183123e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 8.572947907126149e-10, 'MeetingStatus': 2.6892048587967565e-09, 'OralStatement': 8.983720989341748e-10, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.1306987285640844e-09, 'RVRequested': 1.0783538992309438e-11, 'RVTaken': 3.044616295189151e-11, 'Session': 1.9660414962707762e-10, 'Sponsorship': 6.491929216423387e-11, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.126154335397757e-10, 'Vote': 1.8959791514561175e-09, 'VotingIntention': 7.53699946898223e-09}\",\n[[\"Lodhi\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Pakistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Pakistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Italy\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Sylvie Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Luxembourg\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Pakistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"decision 62/557\", \"D\"], [\"five\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"about two decades ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"Two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"nought\", \"TIME\"], [\"secondly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Pakistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"five decades ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"the twenty-first century\", \"DATE\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Secondly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Thirdly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Fourthly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"more than one third\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Pakistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"A week ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"the Charter of the United Nations\", \"PERSON\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 225,\n            'f': \"225\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 49,\n            'f': \"49\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999994039535522,\n            'f': \"0.9999994039535522\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. De Aguiar Patriota (Brazil): Let me thank you, Mr. President, for convening this important meeting. I start by saying that we align ourselves with the statement delivered by Ambassador Harald Braun, Permanent Representative of Germany, on behalf of the Group of Four, and with the intervention of Ambassador Menissa Rambally, Permanent Representative of Saint Lucia on behalf of the L.69 group. I want to welcome the appointment of Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, as Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations. Brazil pledges its full support to Ambassador Lucas and her team in this endeavour. As reflected in Assembly decision 69/560, adopted by consensus in September, and as highlighted in your letter, Mr. President, of 23 October, our work in the upcoming months should build upon the important progress achieved during the latest round of the intergovernmental negotiations, especially on the framework document prepared by Ambassador Courtenay Rattray. Now that we finally have a text on the table, it is time for us to move into concrete negotiations. I wish to take this opportunity to thank Ambassador Rattray for his bold stewardship and his strong commitment to a transparent and inclusive process. As the United Nations turns 70, the Organization has demonstrated a capacity to rise to challenges in a variety of areas. The United Nations system has recently succeeded in adopting an ambitious, forward-looking agenda, with significant potential for impact over the coming years and decades. Such is the nature of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), an extraordinary achievement that reflects a common vision for international cooperation on the intersection of economic, social and environmental concerns. In the human rights pillar, progress has been further consolidated in the past years with the establishment of the universal periodic review process, which allows for the human rights records of all Member States to be reviewed and assessed. The three reports that are currently being considered by the United Nations membership \\u2014 produced by the High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations (see A/70/95), the Advisory Group of Experts on the Review of the Peacebuilding Architecture (see A/69/968) and the authors of the global study on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) \\u2014 represent a solid foundation to underpin our discussions on the review of the policies and practices of the Organization concerning international peace and security. Notwithstanding those important discussions, we will not be able to address the Organization\\u2019s growing credibility gap on matters related to peace and security if we do not adapt the anachronistic structure and dynamics of the Security Council to the geopolitical realities of the twenty-first century. There is an emerging consensus that the United Nations needs to update its governance mechanisms and establish a renewed commitment to searching for solutions through more effective cooperative efforts in the field of promoting peace and security. At a time when we face the largest refugee crisis since the Second World War and the number of civilian victims of armed conflicts worldwide continues to increase, we cannot afford to allow the Security Council to have its authority eroded, bringing discredit on the entire United Nations. If our goal is to have a more functional Security Council, perpetuating the geopolitical status quo by an expansion restricted to the non-permanent category is not an option. Brazil firmly believes that the only way to ensure a more efficient and democratic Security Council is through an expansion that includes new permanent members. Let us recall that there are entire regions of the world that are absent from the permanent member category, Africa being a case in point, as well as Latin America and the Caribbean. Last Saturday, we celebrated 70 years of the entering into force of the Charter of the United Nations. When the Charter was signed, in 1945, the Organization had 51 Member States and the Security Council was composed of 11 members \\u2014 five permanent and six non-permanent. By the early 1960s, the United Nations membership had doubled to around 115 members, so an expansion of the Council was envisaged and arduously won, leading to the inclusion of four additional non-permanent seats. Today the United Nations is composed of 193 Member States, while the Security Council continues to function under the same format, with the permanent membership category never having been altered. That is to say, the Council still reflects a mid-twentieth century diplomatic environment even as we enter the second half of the second decade of the twenty-first century. If we are to establish a renewed international compact to deal with peace and security through international law and multilateralism, we cannot forego our responsibility in dealing with this matter. The alternatives are too dramatic to contemplate. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.0242719561404101e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.9282133667530843e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 3.77580775534625e-08, 'Body': 1.0533577482485512e-10, 'Clarification': 1.5844188183677943e-08, 'Conclusion': 2.3618522693169552e-09, 'Election': 2.5485023869009638e-08, 'General': 0.9999994039535522, 'Introduction': 4.2622744444997807e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.028821999289221e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 1.2457991971359661e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 1.4748468002423465e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 7.052550188291207e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 1.0799418248552684e-08, 'OralStatement': 4.262867836501982e-09, 'PresidingOfficer': 7.676492330688234e-09, 'RVRequested': 1.528863008415371e-10, 'RVTaken': 3.500469913930715e-10, 'Session': 2.049966640882417e-09, 'Sponsorship': 5.317287721240405e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.885244570511759e-09, 'Vote': 1.053218134927647e-08, 'VotingIntention': 4.8753566517234503e-08}\",\n[[\"De Aguiar\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Brazil\", \"UNPE\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Harald Braun\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Germany\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Menissa Rambally\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Saint Lucia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Sylvie Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Luxembourg\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Brazil\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"decision 69/560\", \"D\"], [\"September\", \"DATE\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"23 October\", \"DATE\"], [\"the upcoming months\", \"DATE\"], [\"Courtenay Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"turns 70\", \"DATE\"], [\"the coming years and decades\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolution 70/1\", \"R\"], [\"the past years\", \"DATE\"], [\"three\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"A/70/95\", \"Symbol\"], [\"A/69/968\", \"Symbol\"], [\"resolution 1325\", \"R\"], [\"2000\", \"DATE\"], [\"the twenty-first century\", \"DATE\"], [\"Brazil\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Last Saturday\", \"DATE\"], [\"70 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Charter\", \"PERSON\"], [\"1945\", \"DATE\"], [\"51\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"11\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"five\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"six\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the early 1960s\", \"DATE\"], [\"around 115\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"four\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Today\", \"DATE\"], [\"193\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"a mid-twentieth century\", \"DATE\"], [\"the second half of the second decade of the twenty-first century\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 226,\n            'f': \"226\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 50,\n            'f': \"50\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999938011169434,\n            'f': \"0.9999938011169434\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Cardi (Italy), Vice-President, took the Chair There is no longer any justification for evading this challenge, especially when other daunting tasks before the international community are being dealt with multilaterally.

The President and Ambassador Lucas can help Member States make it happen during the seventieth session of the General Assembly. \",\n\"{'Action': 8.527734394192521e-07, 'ActionObject': 2.564066292620737e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 1.3605639992420038e-07, 'Body': 9.376540655026133e-10, 'Clarification': 5.618364866677439e-07, 'Conclusion': 1.0543357298331557e-08, 'Election': 8.023874897844507e-08, 'General': 0.9999938011169434, 'Introduction': 2.452470880598412e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 3.332844755732367e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 1.1375735198271286e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 2.348456762391038e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 1.0323804033873785e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 2.6607548875290377e-07, 'OralStatement': 2.339900362358094e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 6.117089696999756e-07, 'RVRequested': 4.5537593140743127e-10, 'RVTaken': 2.539834786929873e-09, 'Session': 7.060084072918471e-09, 'Sponsorship': 4.458195146384014e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.1441686587641016e-07, 'Vote': 1.2823376493997785e-07, 'VotingIntention': 6.096322522353148e-07}\",\n[[\"Cardi\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Italy\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2030\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Lucas\", \"PERSON\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 227,\n            'f': \"227\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 51,\n            'f': \"51\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 1.0,\n            'f': \"1.0\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. D\\u00edaz de la Guardia Beuno (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): At the outset, I wish to express my appreciation to the President for the interest he is showing on the issue of reforming the Security Council, in close collaboration with all States Members of the United Nations. We warmly congratulate Ambassador Sylvie Lucas on her appointment to her important position. She can count on Spain\\u2019s full support. I should also like to express our appreciation to her predecessor, Ambassador Rattray, for his work during his mandate. We fully endorse the statement delivered earlier by the Permanent Representative of Italy on behalf of the Uniting for Consensus group. I should like to make some additional comments. After working for a long time on the process of reforming the Security Council, my delegation has learned that our strength comes from unity, whereas divisive approaches and actions only lead to delays and further complications. The States Members of the United Nations share the goal of a more representative, accountable, effective and democratic Security Council. If we are to achieve that goal, then we must stand ready to consider new ideas and build bridges between the various groups and positions. I address Ambassador Lucas to say that achieving that objective requires of us a totally transparent and inclusive process based on broad-based consultations and ensuring a constant exchange of information, without unjustified haste or artificial deadlines. We have every confidence in her experience and ability to successfully fulfil this task. We are eager to see a modern version of the Security Council that is more representative and influential, where we see a reflection of the changes that have taken place in recent years and the ability to adapt itself to future changes. We especially want to see a Council where small States and African countries also can make their voices heard. Spain believes that increasing their presence will help make the Council more representative. But we need much more than that. We also believe that we must increase the possibilities for all Member States to sit on the Council on a periodic basis. The best way to achieve that objective is to increase the number of elected seats, which is a step that would also make the Council a more democratic and accountable body vis-\\u00e0-vis all the Members of the Organization. Members all know that my country is against creating new permanent seats, for we believe that would not make the Council more representative or effective. On the contrary, we would be creating an exclusive Council rather than a more inclusive one and would be turning our back on the need to make it more democratic and more credible. We need a responsible and effective Council. Those two characteristics go hand in hand. Spain supports the idea of allowing those Member States that want to make a meaningful contribution to the work of the Council to serve on it for longer periods and more frequently. Spain believes in a Security Council based on merit, not priviliges. My delegation shares the proposal of the Uniting for Consensus group to create seats of longer duration, as well as the possibility of immediate re-election. That formula would make it possible for those States that so wish, and are in a position to do so, to contribute more to the work of the Council. In conclusion, I reiterate Spain\\u2019s willingness to work alongside other groups and Member States to reach a timely, optimal and consensus-based solution. \",\n\"{'Action': 5.090379784356003e-10, 'ActionObject': 1.9061673073306196e-10, 'AgendaStatus': 1.0351586254842005e-09, 'Body': 1.9899509557524953e-12, 'Clarification': 1.6892354182118652e-09, 'Conclusion': 8.243905558202869e-11, 'Election': 2.179031177718116e-09, 'General': 1.0, 'Introduction': 7.245649413789579e-09, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.7478600511378062e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 3.173434293124444e-10, 'MeetingNumber': 2.7969893762191944e-11, 'MeetingSegment': 2.348860272949338e-10, 'MeetingStatus': 6.851526568318889e-10, 'OralStatement': 3.2724595255828604e-10, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.7958727827636096e-10, 'RVRequested': 2.831048546633741e-12, 'RVTaken': 8.412786092759639e-12, 'Session': 9.744871576344849e-11, 'Sponsorship': 4.0752037161473353e-11, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 5.5767446216492544e-11, 'Vote': 1.0475784684160772e-09, 'VotingIntention': 1.7140966424022963e-09}\",\n[[\"D\\u00edaz de la Guardia\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Spain\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sylvie Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Spain\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Italy\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"recent years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Spain\", \"UNPE\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Spain\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Spain\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Spain\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 228,\n            'f': \"228\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 52,\n            'f': \"52\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 1.0,\n            'f': \"1.0\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Okamura (Japan): I would like to associate myself fully with the statement delivered earlier by Ambassador Harald Braun of Germany on behalf of the Group of Four (G-4) countries. Allow me to start by drawing attention to decision 69/560, which Member States adopted by consensus last month. This was not just another technical, business-as- usual decision. It was the decision to formally recognize the text and its annex circulated by the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, on 31 July of this year as the basis for intergovernmental negotiations. The text is a product of everyone, under the able chairmanship of Ambassador Courtenay Rattray. I wish to thank him for his strong stewardship, dedication and hard work. I recall that in March Member States were briefed on the way forward to the text. It was made very clear that each and every Member State was welcome to populate the framework document with proposals and positions. Submissions to the framework document were kindly accepted even after the deadline. Each and every Member State that populated the framework document was consulted intensively before the text was circulated. In other words, the train for reform was always there for us. Everyone who wished to get on board was able to do so whenever they wished. We now have more than 120 passengers. Every passenger is treated equally and is well seated. Seats still remain for more passengers who have not yet gotten on the train. I cannot think of a more membership-driven method for intergovernmental negotiations than this. Japan therefore congratulates and warmly welcomes Her Excellency Ms. Sylvie Lucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, as the new driver of this beautiful train. Although the text may not be as concise and operational as my delegation initially called for, I accept it because it is a product of everyone. I believe that is why Member States adopted by consensus decision 69/560 to roll over the text to this session of the General Assembly as the basis for text-based negotiations. Japan supports the new Chair in moving the process forward towards actually launching text-based negotiations. I am sure many other Member States will join in that endeavour. The text is an important starting point for text-based negotiations, and yet it is only a starting point. I believe all Member States agree that we need to reform the Security Council in order to enhance its effectiveness and that we need to expand its membership to reflect the realities of the international community in the twenty-first century. The only thing we cannot agree on at this moment is the configuration of the reformed Council and the treatment of the veto \\u2014 two issues. Reform requires negotiations. Negotiations require a text. I believe Member States can negotiate to bridge those only remaining substantial gaps based on the text. Geopolitical realities have changed over the past 70 years. There are more Member States in today\\u2019s world that have both the capacity and the willingness to take on the primary responsibility of maintaining international peace and security. If we increase only non-permanent members, that will not bring an appropriate balance to reflect geopolitical realities in the Council. The expansion of permanent membership will surely strengthen the Council\\u2019s functioning, and that is in line with the spirit of Article 23 of the Charter of the United Nations. I understand there are some Member States that argue that we should greatly enhance the representation of developing countries but support only the expansion of non-permanent seats or the creation of a new category. I would like to ask those Member States for their views. What is their answer to the aspiration of our African friends, without having them as permanent members, considering what our African friends call the \\u201chistorical injustice done to Africa\\u201d? Do they think that the legitimate aspiration expressed by our African friends can be met by their argument? We need to address the most controversial question \\u2014 the veto. Initiatives put forward, most notably by France and the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group, on restraining its use in situations of mass atrocities are receiving growing support. Japan supports both those initiatives. It is important to capitalize on the momentum generated by the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. The G-4 leaders, who gathered here in New York on 26 September, agreed on and pledged to reach out to Member States to achieve early and meaningful reform of the Security Council. The G-4 is determined to redouble its efforts towards securing concrete outcomes during this session of the General Assembly. My delegation very much expects the President\\u2019s leadership on this important agenda item and will support him as we make progress during this very critical year of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.501354951471967e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.3296871381740516e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 1.029949991959711e-08, 'Body': 3.4431197476481046e-11, 'Clarification': 1.191565335290079e-08, 'Conclusion': 5.098522160018604e-10, 'Election': 1.472341271124833e-08, 'General': 1.0, 'Introduction': 2.7251386924831422e-08, 'MeetingDateTime': 9.31844046370145e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 3.517091506921588e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 2.8223226533619084e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 3.037056162114027e-09, 'MeetingStatus': 9.614317342254708e-09, 'OralStatement': 5.455300211565373e-09, 'PresidingOfficer': 4.578489587458989e-09, 'RVRequested': 1.9944776732949698e-11, 'RVTaken': 1.3073725435575057e-10, 'Session': 1.098085289363837e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.9059381850539125e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 9.711255133382224e-10, 'Vote': 2.934422260736369e-09, 'VotingIntention': 1.2488404088628613e-08}\",\n[[\"Okamura\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Japan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Harald Braun\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Germany\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"decision 69/560\", \"D\"], [\"last month\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sam Kutesa\", \"PERSON\"], [\"31 July of this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Courtenay Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"March\", \"DATE\"], [\"more than 120\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Japan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sylvie Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Luxembourg\", \"UNPE\"], [\"decision 69/560\", \"D\"], [\"Japan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the twenty-first century\", \"DATE\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"past 70\", \"PARA\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"\\u201chistorical injustice done to Africa\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"France\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Japan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"26 September\", \"DATE\"], [\"this very critical year\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 229,\n            'f': \"229\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 53,\n            'f': \"53\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.999991774559021,\n            'f': \"0.999991774559021\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Lauber (Switzerland) (spoke in French): We would like to thank the President for convening this meeting on the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council.

We did so because we saw it as hampering the Council\\u2019s effectiveness and legitimacy. Today those same reasons underscore our support for Security Council reform, reform that will ensure that the Council is able to respond to modern realities and uphold its Charter responsibilities transparently, credibly and effectively. Put simply, the Council\\u2019s effectiveness and legitimacy require, first, an expansion of its membership to reflect today\\u2019s geopolitical realities, secondly, limits on the use of the veto, and thirdly, greater transparency in the Council\\u2019s workings. Australia strongly supports the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group\\u2019s code of conduct on Security Council action in situations of mass atrocities, and the complementary French/Mexican political declaration on veto restraint. The strong, almost overwhelming, support from the United Nations membership for those proposals underscores how fundamental this reform is for the proper functioning of the United Nations in advancing international peace and security. The onus now is on the Security Council to respond. We also urge all Council members to continue making the Council more accessible, transparent and inclusive. Openness and transparency can, and should, be integrated into the day-to-day workings of the Council. Expansion of the Council\\u2019s membership is essential for the Council\\u2019s continued legitimacy and relevance. The Council continues to be badly out of step with the evolution of the world\\u2019s geopolitics. For those reasons, Australia supports expansion in both the permanent and non-permanent categories, including for a more equitable geographical balance. The Council benefits from a diverse and changing elected membership. It will be crucial to ensure that any changes to membership or duration of Council terms do not prevent a diverse range of countries from seeking election and serving as elected members. Together we, the United Nations membership, made substantial progress in the intergovernmental negotiations during the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We warmly commend Ambassador Rattray for leading a transparent, inclusive, results-oriented process in which more than 120 Member States contributed to the framework text. That was an important achievement. Seventy years after the United Nations was established, the time has now come to move to text- based negotiations on Council reform, on the basis of resolution 69/560 and the framework text. We have an unmistakable responsibility to reshape and adapt the Security Council so it is able to address the complex peace and security challenges over the next 70 years. We therefore warmly welcome Ambassador Lucas\\u2019s appointment to lead the intergovernmental negotiations process, and we pledge Australia\\u2019s full cooperation to achieve a strong result under her leadership. \",\n\"{'Action': 3.2701648056132626e-09, 'ActionObject': 1.8151355973827776e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 8.203430823527924e-09, 'Body': 2.625068738770775e-11, 'Clarification': 7.405332347332205e-09, 'Conclusion': 6.394687002142518e-10, 'Election': 1.0244445292073578e-08, 'General': 1.0, 'Introduction': 3.38662893284436e-08, 'MeetingDateTime': 7.834097259795669e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 2.0269508294035177e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 3.085428579296945e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 8.613370461318937e-09, 'MeetingStatus': 2.610785587719988e-09, 'OralStatement': 3.916212243382233e-09, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.3265031295617291e-09, 'RVRequested': 3.061340070331653e-11, 'RVTaken': 1.0196460342726255e-10, 'Session': 7.811507551913621e-10, 'Sponsorship': 4.1792211358249176e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 5.528337787552573e-10, 'Vote': 2.4220867533841783e-09, 'VotingIntention': 1.0959493756956817e-08}\",\n[[\"Bird\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Australia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Seventy years ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"1945\", \"DATE\"], [\"1946\", \"DATE\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Australia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Today\", \"DATE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"secondly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"thirdly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Australia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"day-to-day\", \"DATE\"], [\"Australia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"sixty-ninth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"more than 120\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Seventy years\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolution 69/560\", \"R\"], [\"the next 70 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Australia\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 231,\n            'f': \"231\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 55,\n            'f': \"55\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999998807907104,\n            'f': \"0.9999998807907104\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Flores Herrera (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): At the outset, I would like to begin by welcoming decision 69/560, adopted at the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly under the presidency of Mr. Sam Kutesa, to continue with intergovernmental negotiations on reforming the Security Council, a goal shared by more than 90 per cent of Member States. We acknowledge and commend the leadership and commendable work carried out as Chair by Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, Permanent Representative of Jamaica, to bring us to today\\u2019s point where we have a text on which we can negotiate. The transparency, dedication and discipline with which Ambassador Rattray led the discussions should be emulated in any United Nations process. We feel optimistic about the commitment taken on and expressed by President Lykketoft at the seventieth session of the General Assembly, as well as his decision that the negotiations going forward should be led by the Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, representative of another small country that is committed to this reform process and that has shown good examples of making sure that equity, justice and morality prevail in the various organizational and decision-making processes. In addition, we welcome the fact that a woman is presiding over the work involved in the reform of the Security Council, fulfilling the objective of promoting gender equality and empowering women, and is also bringing her vast experience, sensitivity and knowledge to this position. The Security Council was born out of a cataclysmic time for humankind \\u2014 out of the ashes and suffering of a world war. However, in our changing world in 70 years we have seen only one substantive revision. Although the Security Council has been successful in preventing another global conflict, we are today seeing explosions of humanitarian crises that also transcend borders and present huge challenges to the peace and security of the world. The tragedies of refugees, of terrorism \\u2014 just those situations affect so many people. Those women, men and children are those whom we do not want to be left behind in the Sustainable Development Agenda. Hence we must promote the reform of the sole United Nations organ whose decisions are binding and strictly implemented. The reform of the Security Council and other related matters are an essential component if we are to revitalize the United Nations as a body and make it fit for purpose in fulfilling the noble Agenda to which we recently subscribed (resolution 70/1). This issue is critical to the maintenance of international peace and security and is also intrinsically bound up with sustainable development. As Pope Francis said, in a world of of unfettered ambition and collective selfishness, it has never been more necessary to appeal to the moral conscience of the human being. We need a paradigm shift that emphasizes ethical values and to make sure that our actions are just and proper. The Security Council needs to be revitalized to make it not only more representative but also more effective, transparent and open to accountability to the international community. The recent launch of the code of conduct to restrict the use of the veto in the Security Council is an initial step towards that long-awaited reform and begin to rid ourselves of the anachronistic distinctions between permanent and non-permanent members. Let us resolve to crown this seventieth year of the United Nations with a decision on the reform of the Security Council. Let us not remain stuck in the debate we began more than 20 years ago concerning the urgent need to reform it. We are an Organization that has quadrupled in membership over those 70 years \\u2014 a sign that the world has evolved and will continue to do so. That reality, which reflects a new historic moment in the life of the United Nations, must also be reflected in an internal adaptation of its bodies so that its structure, functioning and dynamics respond to 193 Member States, which should let go of any of rights or priviliges conferred upon them in other circumstances. Panama will continue to participate actively in the intergovernmental process to reform the Security Council, devoted to our calling to offer compromises, trying to bring seemly polarized positions closer together. We are convinced that the elements that unite us outnumber our differences. That is our commitment to \\u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations\\u201d, to whom we are responsible. \",\n\"{'Action': 6.336725810740518e-09, 'ActionObject': 5.276497017092652e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 1.2552353823025442e-08, 'Body': 4.503445186210264e-11, 'Clarification': 1.2895348788788397e-08, 'Conclusion': 9.19730680504216e-10, 'Election': 1.1792923970688207e-08, 'General': 0.9999998807907104, 'Introduction': 8.851520760799758e-08, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.3124974440614778e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 2.8818833985866377e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 3.8389760814716567e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 1.0058071708840544e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 4.423899468974923e-09, 'OralStatement': 4.384034024695893e-09, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.858022263296789e-09, 'RVRequested': 5.6652883773100626e-11, 'RVTaken': 1.4143158866275485e-10, 'Session': 7.225578468883498e-10, 'Sponsorship': 5.062898988938969e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.1719104575647066e-09, 'Vote': 2.9221121078393253e-09, 'VotingIntention': 1.6434618999028316e-08}\",\n[[\"Flores Herrera\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Panama\", \"UNPE\"], [\"decision 69/560\", \"D\"], [\"sixty-ninth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Sam Kutesa\", \"PERSON\"], [\"more than 90\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Courtenay Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Jamaica\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Lykketoft\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Luxembourg\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sylvie Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"70 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolution 70/1\", \"R\"], [\"Pope Francis\", \"PERSON\"], [\"this seventieth year\", \"DATE\"], [\"more than 20 years ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"those 70 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"193\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Panama\", \"UNPE\"], [\"\\u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 232,\n            'f': \"232\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 56,\n            'f': \"56\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999994039535522,\n            'f': \"0.9999994039535522\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Winid (Poland): I wish to thank the President for convening this annual General Assembly debate and for his commitment to Security Council reform. I would like to assure him of Poland\\u2019s support in his efforts towards that goal. We also welcome and congratulate the Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, on her appointment as the new Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations. I take this opportunity to thank Ambassador Courtenay Rattray of Jamaica for his dedication, leadership and excellent work during the last round of the intergovernmental negotiations. One of our birthday wishes to the United Nations as it turned 70 was to have a more representative, effective, transparent and responsible Security Council. We would like to see that organ adapted to the realities of today\\u2019s world and fully complying with its responsibilities as envisaged in the Charter of the United Nations. Poland now looks forward to the immediate resumption of the intergovernmental negotiations, as was agreed upon in September by us, the General Assembly. My delegation is convinced that by building on the work undertaken during the Assembly\\u2019s last session we will be able to take another significant step forward towards Council reform. In order to reach the much-needed consensus, we must continue an open dialogue that creates room for everyone to express their opinions and arguments. The United Nations is made up of regional groups of different sizes. All of them advocate their equitable representation on the reformed Council. We firmly believe that the ambitions of the Group of African States, as well as the Asian, Pacific and Latin American countries, are equally justified. But being a member of the Group of Eastern European States \\u2014 the smallest among the regional groups but at the same time one that has also witnessed a noticeable increase over the last decades \\u2014 we would like to repeat our call for an additional non-permanent seat for the Eastern European Group. We also support efforts to make the Council\\u2019s actions more transparent and effective. Poland gladly contributed to the Security Council\\u2019s open debate (see S/PV.7539) on its working methods held last week under the very able Spanish presidency. Finally, with respect to the question of the veto power, we wish to welcome the growing number of supporters of the French/Mexican proposal on restraint in its use. Poland has also endorsed the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group\\u2019s code of conduct that aims at timely and decisive Security Council action against genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.965581120089155e-08, 'ActionObject': 4.879856962958229e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 7.63632286293614e-08, 'Body': 2.5337126841051827e-10, 'Clarification': 3.921361368952603e-08, 'Conclusion': 7.103320154300263e-09, 'Election': 6.675895747321192e-08, 'General': 0.9999994039535522, 'Introduction': 1.537525946559981e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.8645810168370645e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 1.3709700041886208e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 1.94623361871038e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 3.611011933912778e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 2.7507045530228424e-08, 'OralStatement': 2.7671756441804973e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.3519926511662561e-08, 'RVRequested': 2.7576835259779386e-10, 'RVTaken': 9.240416765088355e-10, 'Session': 6.065752788941836e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.2945313709877837e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.142887949891815e-09, 'Vote': 1.127320459204384e-08, 'VotingIntention': 6.273792507727194e-08}\",\n[[\"Winid\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Poland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"annual\", \"DATE\"], [\"Poland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Luxembourg\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sylvie Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Courtenay Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Jamaica\", \"UNPE\"], [\"One\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"70\", \"DATE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Poland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"September\", \"DATE\"], [\"the last decades\", \"DATE\"], [\"Poland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"last week\", \"DATE\"], [\"Poland\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 233,\n            'f': \"233\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 57,\n            'f': \"57\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999997615814209,\n            'f': \"0.9999997615814209\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Andanje (Kenya): My delegation attaches great importance to the subject before us. Let me begin by commending Ambassador Courtenay Rattray of Jamaica, outgoing Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations on reform of the Security Council. His dedication and commitment to moving forward the negotiations at the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly deserves our praise. I also congratulate Her Excellency Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, on her appointment to chair the intergovernmental negotiations. It is an onerous task. I do not envy her. Nevertheless, I am confident she will be able to build on her predecessor\\u2019s work as the basis of our efforts to advance reform of the Security Council. I assure her of my delegation\\u2019s support and cooperation. My delegation fully aligns itself with the statement delivered earlier by the representative of Sierra Leone, coordinator of the Group of African States. Kenya reaffirms its full support and commitment to the common African position and Africa\\u2019s legitimate claim embodied in the Ezulwini Consensus. My delegation is pleased that the African Group statement has comprehensively touched on the substantive issues on Security Council reform that are of the greatest concern to Africa and the wider United Nations membership. In the interests of brevity and to avoid repetition, my delegation would like to take this opportunity to highlight the following points. I believe I speak for many here when I say that our countries occasionally come under undue pressure on issues of transparency and accountability at the national level. Unfortunately, in the context of governance of international institutions, that is not the case. As the principle organ responsible for maintenance of international peace and security, the Security Council exemplifies a structure that is not compatible with the current realities of the world. It does not reflect the current world power distribution and geopolitical situation. The Council\\u2019s small size and exclusive nature, its relations with the General Assembly and its working methods and undemocratic nature are out of step with today\\u2019s demands. It is antiquated and ill-adapted to fulfil its tasks. Some regions of the world do not have representation on the Council. Indeed, a considerable portion of the United Nations global constituency is unrepresented and unheard in the administration of global affairs. They do not have a say in the policies that directly affect them. Africa, which provides a very large share of the United Nations security agenda and is also the focus of considerable work of the Organization, has no voice in the Council. That is not only discriminatory, but also unfair and unjust. My delegation is convinced that it is imperative that the Council be able to meet contemporary standards and the demands of the twenty-first century. It must meet expectations of legitimacy based on accountability and democracy in its decision-making procedures and representation. It is therefore incumbent upon us, the United Nations membership, collectively to ensure that the Security Council reform process moves forward in accordance with the five guiding principles outlined in decision 62/557. Finally, my delegation looks forward to engaging in open and transparent negotiations in which the entire membership have an equal voice. We believe the work carried out thus far provides a valuable basis for our collective efforts to work towards reform of the Security Council. We must build on this as part of our efforts to make the United Nations a more efficient and effective instrument in the service of all the peoples of the world. \",\n\"{'Action': 3.222229594257442e-09, 'ActionObject': 6.026301124784084e-10, 'AgendaStatus': 1.0978927988958276e-08, 'Body': 2.3214003636029545e-11, 'Clarification': 8.9022593741106e-09, 'Conclusion': 1.4697588701650943e-09, 'Election': 5.012876336252248e-09, 'General': 0.9999997615814209, 'Introduction': 2.519133488476655e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 3.6225022981284383e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 3.125809389104006e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 2.5778632006812074e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 5.719700713058273e-09, 'MeetingStatus': 3.8109777555916935e-09, 'OralStatement': 1.091921775220328e-09, 'PresidingOfficer': 5.062678276601673e-09, 'RVRequested': 4.7826863996958124e-11, 'RVTaken': 1.0186215065877136e-10, 'Session': 6.108360484091691e-10, 'Sponsorship': 1.3151879585393544e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 9.564689040786334e-10, 'Vote': 3.48477158240712e-09, 'VotingIntention': 2.094619233616868e-08}\",\n[[\"Andanje\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Courtenay Rattray\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Jamaica\", \"UNPE\"], [\"sixty-ninth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Sylvie Lucas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Luxembourg\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sierra Leone\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"the twenty-first century\", \"DATE\"], [\"five\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"decision 62/557\", \"D\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 234,\n            'f': \"234\",\n        },\n\"A_70_PV.43-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 58,\n            'f': \"58\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999990463256836,\n            'f': \"0.9999990463256836\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Sarki (Nigeria): Let me first thank the President and the secretariat for accommodating us to speak at this time at the end of the morning\\u2019s meeting. First, Nigeria would like to commend the President for the determination that he has shown to move the intergovernmental negotiations process on Security Council reform forward during the seventieth session of the General Assembly. In particular, we commend him for convening this important meeting, which is in fulfilment of his promise contained in the letter of 23 October circulated to all missions. Nigeria aligns itself with the statements made earlier by His Excellency Ambassador Vandi Minah, Permanent Representative of Sierra Leone, who spoke on behalf of the Group of African States on the Common African Position, and also Ambassador Menissa Rambally, Permanent Representative of Saint Lucia, who spoke on behalf of the L.69 group. We have been following with keen interest the President\\u2019s views on the subject of Security Council reform ever since he was elected to office as the President of the seventieth session in June 2015. We recall that in his acceptance speech after the election he observed appropriately that: \\u201cMost interest seems to be centred on the reform of the Security Council and creating more transparency and openness when selecting the next Secretary-General\\u201d (A/69/PV.94, p. 3) Thereafter, he assured the Assembly that he would continue this work when the seventieth session began and that he would \\u201cconduct the presidency as transparently, inclusively and openly as possible.\\u201d (ibid.) It is noteworthy that the issue of the reform of the Security Council continues to receive attention at the highest levels. It is important for us to recall that at the just-concluded India-Africa Summit in New Delhi, leaders underlined the need for an early reform of the Council to adjust to the changing realities of the world. Nigeria commends Member States for adopting decision 69/560, of 14 September 2015, by which the General Assembly reaffirmed its central role on the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to its work. By this, Member States also decided to continue with the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform in informal plenary of the General Assembly during the seventieth session. Consistent with this decision, it will be recalled that the President, in his opening address at the commencement of the seventieth session on 15 September, reassured Member States by stating that, responding to \\u201cthe continued interest among many Member States in both the reform of the Security Council and in creating more transparency and openness when selecting the next Secretary-General, I will continue the work mandated by Member States on both of those issues.\\u201d (A/70/PV.1, p. 2). Similarly, in his opening speech of the general debate on 28 September, he underscored his resolve to support \\u201cnew ideas on how to strengthen global peace and security, from the role of women to conflict prevention, mediation and settlement; from United Nations peace operations to the overall peacebuilding architecture and Security Council reform.\\u201d (A/70/PV.13, p. 5) These are very important commitments that the President has given to Member States. His commitment to this process resonated in the content of his letter of 23 October, wherein he informed Member States of his appointment of Her Excellency Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, as Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations during the seventieth session. In the letter he rightly observed that the discussion on this subject gained greater momentum during the sixty-ninth session under the leadership of the Honourable Sam Kutesa, whom we wish to commend for his steadfast commitment to the reform of the Security Council. Against that backdrop, we must strive to build on the laudable achievement recorded during the previous session, when for the first time we had a text upon which negotiations would now be based. Consequently, we are very hopeful that today\\u2019s meeting and subsequent steps will firmly build on this momentum. The cadence must not drop. The tempo must be sustained. We commend Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, Permanent Representative of Jamaica, who chaired the process at its eleventh round, during the sixty-ninth session, for his exemplary leadership. In the same vein we welcome the appointment of Ambassador Lucas and congratulate her on it. We are grateful to her for accepting this enormous responsibility and assure her of our cooperation. We encourage her to inject new vigour into the process and determinedly move it forward in a significant way during the seventieth session. Nigeria has always expressed its support for the advancement of the intergovernmental negotiations process in an open, inclusive and transparent manner. As we prepare to move into the next round of negotiations during this session, we thank all delegations that have continued to express their support for the Common African Position. We would like to seize this opportunity to reaffirm this Common African Union Position on the entire subject of Security Council reform, to which we adhere very strongly. That is important in order to correct the historical injustice done to the continent and its continued marginalization over so many years. For that reason, we wish to underscore the overriding need to ensure that the interests of Africa continue to be put forward and safeguarded. African States have offered a coherent, practical and persuasive blueprint for the Council\\u2019s reform. We have come up with a common position, which asserts the right of our continent that has for so long been marginalized, and we recognize the legitimate aspirations of other regions to be fully represented in the Council. Security Council reform is inspired by the principles of the Charter itself. The clear objective of this process is based on the sovereign equality of all Member States and on the need to adhere to the principles of democratization and inclusiveness in the United Nations. It is undoubtedly a worthwhile process. Therefore, we must muster the desired political will that can lead to the achievement of a reformed Security Council sooner rather than indefinitely. Finally, what is required of us at this juncture is to move to the stage of actual negotiations with the aid of a text, which is now available to us. There should be marked progress in the forthcoming negotiations far beyond what we achieved during the sixty-ninth session. We look forward with great optimism to the next line of actions during the seventieth session. We assure the President of our full cooperationin that respect. \",\n\"{'Action': 2.5340426645925618e-08, 'ActionObject': 3.431438599932335e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 1.1276831202167159e-07, 'Body':

Following this 1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the year\\u2019s review of that Process and agreement on Provisions of the United Nations Convention on improvements to it, we look forward to addressing the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 capacity-building in ocean affairs and the law of the relating to the Conservation and Management sea, including marine science, in 2010 and other of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory critical oceans-related issues in the years beyond. Fish Stocks, and related instruments This year\\u2019s resolution on sustainable fisheries Report of the Secretary-General (A/64/305) once again contains important provisions to address critical issues such as better regulation of destructive fishing practices, control of illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing, reduction of fishing capacity, emphasis on science-based conservation and management measures, implementation of the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement, strengthened conservation and management of sharks, and other important matters. However, perhaps the most notable aspect of this year\\u2019s resolution is the provisions to strengthen and enhance the regulation of bottom- fishing activities and the impact of such activities on vulnerable marine ecosystems in areas beyond national jurisdiction. In 2006, the United States, along with many other countries, successfully sought strong provisions in the sustainable fisheries resolution to address the critical gap in oceans governance with respect to bottom fisheries. In our view, the provisions contained in resolution 61/105 were a landmark step forward for sustainable bottom fisheries and in protecting fragile and rare marine ecosystems from adverse impacts of fishing activities. In the three years since the adoption of resolution 61/105, the international community has made significant and important progress in implementing the calls made in it. This year\\u2019s sustainable fisheries draft resolution reviews the progress in implementing those calls and further refines recommendations to assist States and regional fisheries management organizations with the implementation of those provisions. Delegations recognized that States and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements (RFMOs) have taken important and tangible steps to implement resolution 61/105, including beginning \\u2014 and, in the case of the South Pacific, completing \\u2014 negotiations to establish two new RFMOs where they do not currently exist. However, delegations also expressed concern that implementation has been uneven and not sufficient in all cases. Therefore, delegations crafted language to strengthen and focus action where it is urgently needed. As a result, the United States is pleased that this year\\u2019s sustainable fisheries draft resolution contains a package of provisions that clearly articulates what urgent actions States and RFMOs should take to ensure full implementation of resolution 61/105, and that it encourages enhanced cooperation among States and RFMOs in achieving that goal. The United States will continue to work with others to advance this issue 2 through the relevant RFMOs and through negotiations to establish new organizations. Much work remains if we are to ensure the sustainability of global fish stocks. RFMOs continue to be the best available mechanism for regulating international fisheries. Nonetheless, there is much room for improvement within those organizations to advance our common goals. To that end, a number of RFMOs have embarked on systematic reviews of their performance. Those efforts must be recognized and commended. However, the recommendations of those reviews must now be implemented to bring about much-needed reform and modernization within RFMOs. Such reform must also address how States implement and enforce the rules that they adopt as members of such organizations. The United States will be looking ahead to the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement Review Conference, scheduled for May 2010, as a venue to consider that and other critical issues facing international fisheries. I wish to thank all the delegations for their hard work in the development of the sustainable fisheries draft resolution. The United States was once again proud to provide the coordinator for the informal consultations, Ms. Holly Koehler, who led the negotiations to their successful conclusion, and we greatly thank her for her work to that end. \",\n\"{'Action': 2.5172496407321887e-06, 'ActionObject': 3.709539896590286e-06, 'AgendaStatus': 2.637239731484442e-06, 'Body': 5.276504566609219e-08, 'Clarification': 2.1420250959636178e-06, 'Conclusion': 1.5469585434857436e-07, 'Election': 1.22903202282032e-06, 'General': 0.9999492168426514, 'Introduction': 7.386350375782058e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.7865119161797338e-07, 'MeetingLocation': 3.61065730203336e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 1.0802219918559786e-07, 'MeetingSegment': 1.1313095455989242e-05, 'MeetingStatus': 4.3463626298034796e-07, 'OralStatement': 2.137418596248608e-05, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.8534066725806042e-07, 'RVRequested': 1.3902047513170146e-08, 'RVTaken': 1.1886602635513555e-07, 'Session': 2.589517009710107e-07, 'Sponsorship': 6.383715458468942e-07, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.608667213939043e-07, 'Vote': 3.890694699748565e-08, 'VotingIntention': 2.2151773464429425e-06}\",\n[[\"(b)\", \"ASI\"], [\"1995\", \"DATE\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"Highly Migratory\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the years\", \"DATE\"], [\"This year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Report of the Secretary-General (A/64/305)\", \"RPT\"], [\"this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"], [\"resolution 61/105\", \"R\"], [\"the three years\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolution 61/105\", \"R\"], [\"This year\", \"DATE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"resolution 61/105\", \"R\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"], [\"this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"resolution 61/105\", \"R\"], [\"2\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"May 2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"Holly Koehler\", \"PERSON\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 251,\n            'f': \"251\",\n        },\n\"A_64_PV.56-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 15,\n            'f': \"15\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999440908432007,\n            'f': \"0.9999440908432007\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Lundkvist (Sweden): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The candidate countries Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the countries of the Stabilization and Association Process and potential candidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia, as well as Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, Armenia and Georgia align themselves with this statement. This year, the European Union has once again demonstrated its commitment to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and to the 1995 United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement by actively participating in the consultations that led to the draft resolutions before the General Assembly today. The European Union believes that the Convention is an important instrument that promotes stability, peace, progress and economic and social advancement, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations. It therefore holds special significance in a difficult international context. The European Union would like to reiterate the importance it attaches to preserving the Convention\\u2019s integrity and the Convention\\u2019s pre-eminent role as the legal framework for all ocean issues and ocean-related activities. The European Union calls upon all States to accede to the Convention and to the Agreement relating to the implementation of Part XI of the Convention. The European Union reiterates the importance it attaches to the freedom of navigation, the right of innocent passage and the right of transit passage in compliance with the relevant provisions of the Convention. The European Union would further like to reiterate its deep concern about the continued acts of piracy, which are detrimental to the safety of persons and property, whether vessels are attacked or hijacked or prisoners are held for ransom. In view of the resurgence of such acts, the international community has committed itself to combating this scourge within the United Nations framework. In that regard, we note the efforts of the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia. Other major challenges remain, such as the declining quality of the marine environment and the destruction of natural marine resources. Marine biodiversity is being threatened, and time is running out if we are to meet the deadlines set in the 2002 Johannesburg Plan of Implementation. The European Union remains firmly committed to addressing those challenges. The European Union has repeatedly and in various forums expressed its concerns over the loss of marine biodiversity and has supported the initiative taken by the General Assembly to create an Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working Group on the matter. The European Union welcomes that the Working Group will reconvene in early 2010 and that its mandate has been confirmed. We also welcome that States are invited to further consider issues of marine protected areas and environmental assessment processes in the context of the Group\\u2019s mandate. The Working Group is in a position to make important recommendations to the Assembly, with a view to forging ahead on the sensitive issue of the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction. The draft omnibus resolution notes the concerns raised in relation to the issue of climate change and its effects on the oceans, seas and natural resources. In that regard the EU would have wished to highlight the state of the Arctic region as a priority area for research. We would also have wished to see a reference to the forthcoming United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference, to be held in Copenhagen from 7 to 18 December 2009. To respond to the debates within the international community, the draft resolution takes into account various issues relating to climate change, such as eutrophication, acidification, fertilization, the discharge of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and greenhouse gases. The international community for the law of the sea the must take an active role in the movement to prevent and combat climate change. At a time when the international scientific community must inspire the work of States and international organizations, the European Union recognizes the relevance of the regular process for global reporting and assessment of the state of the marine environment, including socio-economic aspects. We welcome the convening of another meeting of the Ad Hoc Working Group in 2010, which confirms that the real start-up of the first cycle of the process has begun. In 1999 the General Assembly created a useful and efficient tool for preparing for its debates on oceans and the law of the sea, namely, the Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea. This year, at its ten-year juncture, the focus of discussion was on the implementation of the outcome of the Consultative Process. A very useful review of its achievements and shortcomings in its first meetings was undertaken. The review made clear that the Consultative Process has served and will continue to serve its purpose. The European Union looks forward to the discussions at next year\\u2019s Consultative Process, the theme of which will be capacity-building in oceans affairs and the law of the sea, including marine science. We note the agreement of all parties during the negotiations that this theme should incorporate the issue of the mitigation of the effects of climate change, particularly in respect of developing countries. The European Union is concerned about the substantially increased workload of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf and is mindful of the need to find a sustainable solution to that problem. We therefore welcome the decision of the Nineteenth Meeting of States Parties to the Convention on the Law 3 of the Sea to facilitate an informal working group to continue consideration of how to address that important issue. In relation to the Commission\\u2019s ongoing work, the European Union welcomes the fact that the summaries of most recommendations have been made publicly available, thus enabling all parties to have a better understanding of the entire process. We encourage the Commission to continue to comprehensively reflect its reasoning in the summaries of recommendations, in accordance with the rules of procedure and the confidentiality of the information provided to the Commission. With its 148 operative paragraphs, this year\\u2019s draft resolution on sustainable fisheries has reached an extent which makes it difficult to manage, and the European Union would be in favour of efforts to shorten the resolution in the years to come. Nevertheless, this year a crucial part of the resolution consists of the important review of resolution 61/105 in relation to the impact of bottom fishing on vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs), as called for in paragraph 91 of that resolution. Resolution 61/105 represented a real regime shift, which the EU fully supported and promoted. In fact, in 2008 the EU implemented the calls made by the General Assembly with regard to addressing the impact of deep-sea bottom fishing practices by its vessels in the high seas and in European Community waters. The EU will continue its work with all the relevant stakeholders to deepen and extend knowledge and protection of those habitats and their ecosystems, to develop regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) or arrangements where they do not currently exist, and to urge existing ones to implement effective protection measures for VMEs as far as they have not yet done so. In that regard, the EU recognizes the efforts made by States and RFMOs to conduct scientific surveys and to map VMEs. The EU welcomes and fully endorses the considerable commitment shown at the international level to ensure the continued urgent implementation of measures, in accordance with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FO) Guidelines for the Management of Deep-sea Fisheries in the High Seas, aimed at strengthening impact assessment prior to the authorization of bottom fishing activities and the establishment of encounter protocols, as well as the adoption of conservation and management measures for deep-sea stocks to ensure their long-term 4 sustainability. The next review, foreseen for 2011, will be crucial for the credibility of the commitments made. The EU has long advocated the need for a strong and binding agreement at the international level on port State control, based on the requirement for prior notification by the flag State to the port State to certify that the fish a vessel is carrying have been caught legally, under licence and within quota, before that vessel can be granted access to the port and its facilities. It is that stronger requirement that forms the basis for the port State control schemes recently adopted by a number of RFMOs \\u2014 including the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas and the North Atlantic Fisheries Organization \\u2014 as well as for the port State measures contained in the European Union\\u2019s own regulation on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, which will be applied from 1 January 2010. The EU appreciates that this year\\u2019s draft resolution underscores the approval by the FAO Conference of the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing. Having already signed the agreement on 22 November 2009, the EU fully supports encouraging States to consider signing and ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to it, with a view to its early entry into force. In relation to the impacts of global climate change on the sustainability of fish stocks and the habitats that support them, the draft resolution again urges States to intensify efforts to assess and address such impacts. In relation to the possible consequences of climate change on fishery resources in the Arctic Ocean, the EU would, also in the context of the draft resolution on sustainable fisheries, have wished to highlight the state of the Arctic region as a specific area where further scientific studies should be carried out due to the particular implications that climate change may have on fisheries management in that area in the future. The European Union welcomes the strong endorsement given by the international community to the Kobe process to improve and streamline international management of high-seas tuna fisheries at the meeting which took place in San Sebasti\\u00e1n, Spain, in July 2009. The EU is therefore pleased to see that this year\\u2019s resolution takes the Course of Actions agreed at that meeting into account, including by noting that global fishing capacity for tunas has to be addressed urgently. Finally, the European Union reiterates its attachment to universal adherence to the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement and looks forward to participating in the work related to the resumed Review Conference, which will take place in 2010. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.2245809557498433e-06, 'ActionObject': 1.223607455358433e-06, 'AgendaStatus': 3.823053248197539e-06, 'Body': 5.168699601654225e-08,

have the honour of presenting to the General Assembly the draft omnibus resolution on oceans and the law of the sea (A/64/L.18). It is not fortuitous that the text before us today, like its predecessors, is the longest and one of the most comprehensive resolutions adopted annually by the General Assembly. As recognized in the preamble of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the depth and scope of the issues involved reflect the awareness that \\u201cthe problems of ocean space are closely interrelated and need to be considered as a whole\\u201d. The universal and unified character of the Convention sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out. UNCLOS sets out the strategic framework within which national, regional and global action and cooperation in the marine sector unfold. The need to maintain the integrity of the Convention is an imperative, as recognized, in particular, by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Chapter 17 of Agenda 21. That imperative is even more significant in view of the ever-increasing challenges to sustainable development and the full enjoyment of peace and security. Thus the goal of universal participation in the Convention and the agreement relating to the implementation of its Part XI remain important priorities. Capacity-building is a cross-cutting issue in most areas covered by the draft resolution. The availability in all States, particularly in developing States, of economic, legal, navigational, scientific and technical skills is crucial for the full implementation of the Convention and for meeting the objectives of the draft resolution. Capacity-building, in particular, is required for the sustainable development of the oceans and seas nationally, regionally and globally. The interests and needs of landlocked developing States must also be taken into account in that respect. Those aspects were underscored during the tenth Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea. The Process should, thus, intensify its focus on that important aspect of international cooperation. Capacity-building is also necessary in assisting developing States, especially the least developed and small island developing States and coastal African States, in the preparation of submissions to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf regarding the establishment of the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles. Some developing coastal States have not been able to present, by the 13 May 2009 deadline, full submissions on the outer limits of their continental shelves beyond 200 nautical miles. It is thus imperative to enhance cooperation and assistance to those States in that regard. The capacity-building activities of the Division on Oceans and Law of the Sea of the Office of Legal Affairs should be supported by Member States. The draft resolution recalls the progress made by the International Seabed Authority at its sixteenth session in advancing the consideration of regulations for prospecting and exploration for polymetallic sulphides. It also encourages greater progress on the regulations for prospecting and exploration for cobalt- rich ferromanganese crusts in the Area. In setting the normative framework for the exploration of the common heritage of humankind, the Authority is also preparing, pursuant to article 145 of the Convention, rules, regulations and procedures to ensure the effective protection of the marine environment, including the protection and conservation of the natural resources of the Area. This important role, as well as the responsibilities entrusted to the Authority under article 143 of the Convention with regard to marine scientific research, is duly underscored in the text under consideration. As previously mentioned, 13 May of this year was the deadline for the presentation of submissions by coastal States to the Commission on the limits of their 5 continental shelf, where it extends beyond 200 nautical miles. Since 2001, the Commission has received 51 submissions and has established subcommissions for 13 of them. The Commission has adopted recommendations on nine submissions. Despite its best efforts, including in refining its communication with the coastal States, the Commission is currently faced with several constraints, from the number of sub-commissions that can be established simultaneously to the limited time allocated for the two sessions of approximately six weeks each per year. The Commission has thus estimated that, unless options are found to expedite the consideration of the submissions without prejudice to the efficiency, effectiveness and high level of expertise, it may take until 2035 to conclude consideration of the current workload. This is a major cause of concern for the States parties, especially considering the efforts and resources, both human and financial, deployed by the coastal States, particularly developing ones, in preparing their submissions. Notwithstanding, the draft resolution recalls that pursuant to article 77, paragraph 3, of the Convention, the rights of a coastal State over the continental shelf do not depend on occupation, effective or notional, or on any express proclamation. With a view to addressing the issue of the workload of the Commission, the States parties have established a working group of the whole to consider ways and means to enable the Commission to expedite its work. Utter flexibility must be demonstrated in the search for adequate solutions for supporting the Commission and its secretariat and the Division of Oceans and Law of the Sea of the Office of Legal Affairs, including by allocating resources that are commensurate with the task at hand. The integrity of UNCLOS must be duly preserved in the process. The legal regimes governing maritime safety and maritime security may have common and mutually reinforcing objectives, and all actions taken to combat threats to maritime security must be in accordance with international law, including the principles embodied in the Charter and the Convention. The crucial role of international cooperation should be recognized, both in combating threats to maritime security, in accordance with international law, and in fighting transnational organized criminal 6 activities, within the scope of the United Nations instruments against illicit drug trafficking and of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. The draft resolution recalls the need for enhanced sharing of information among States relevant to the detection, prevention and suppression of threats to maritime security, the need for the prosecution of offenders to pay due regard to national legislation, and the need for sustained capacity-building to support such objectives. Regarding the continuing rise in the number of incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, the text recognizes the importance of a comprehensive and sustainable settlement of the situation in Somalia and the primary role of the Transitional Federal Government in rooting out piracy and armed robbery against ships. It further re-emphasizes the need, in particular, to assist Somalia and States in the region to strengthen their capacity to fight piracy and armed robbery against ships off the coast of Somalia and bring to justice those involved in piracy and armed robbery at sea. The prosecution of those involved in acts of piracy committed off the coast of Somalia commands considerable interest and has been the object of deliberations within the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia, established on 14 January 2009, following the adoption of Security Council resolution 1851 (2008). The draft resolution invites States, the International Maritime Organization and the International Labour Organization to consider possible solutions for the seafarers and fishers who are victims of pirates. The need to ensure freedom of navigation, the safety of navigation and the rights of transit passage, archipelagic sea lanes passage and innocent passage enshrined in the Convention has been consistently promoted by the General Assembly and the draft resolution reiterates the appeal to States in that respect. Likewise, it notes that cessation of the transport of radioactive materials through the regions of small island developing States is a desired goal of small island developing States and some other countries. The draft resolution highlights the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in particular its findings on the acidification of oceans. In that regard, States and competent international organizations and other relevant institutions are encouraged to urgently pursue further research on ocean acidification and to increase national, regional and international efforts to address levels of ocean acidity and the negative impact of such acidity on vulnerable marine ecosystems, particularly coral reefs. It notes the need to enhance scientific activity aimed at better understanding the effects of climate change on the marine environment and marine biodiversity and at developing ways and means of adaptation. A note of caution is needed however, given the present state of knowledge, on ocean fertilization activities. Other than for legitimate scientific research, such activities should not be allowed. Scientific research proposals should be assessed on a case-by- case basis. An assessment framework is to be developed by the scientific groups formed under the London Convention and Protocol. The role of the General Assembly relating to the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction must be emphasized. Further discussion on the relevant legal regime covering marine genetic resources in areas beyond national jurisdiction in accordance with the Convention is also called for. This issue is to be further considered in the context of the mandate of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working Group, which includes the study of issues relating to the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction. The Working Group will meet for the third time in 2010. Progress on this issue is needed, given the abundance and diversity of marine genetic resources and their value in terms of the benefits, goods and services they can provide. It should be recalled that 2010 will be the International Year of Biodiversity. The section on marine science stresses the importance of increasing the scientific understanding of the oceans-atmosphere interface, including through participation in ocean observation programmes and geographic information systems. The intentional or unintentional damaging of platforms used for ocean observation and marine scientific research is a cause of concern. Action and cooperation to address such damage is called for. The text records the progress made in giving effect to the recommendation, contained in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, on the establishment of a regular process for global reporting and assessment of the state of the marine environment, including socio-economic aspects. In that respect, the report on the results of the assessment of assessments submitted by the United Nations Environment Programme and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, the lead agencies of the process, has been an important step and marked the completion of the start-up phase of the Regular Process. An Ad Hoc Working Group of the Whole was established to recommend a course of action to the General Assembly based on the outcomes of the fourth meeting of the Ad Hoc Steering Group, convened in accordance with paragraph 157 of resolution 63/111. The Ad Hoc Working Group of the Whole proposed a framework for the Regular Process. By adopting the text of the draft resolution before it today, the General Assembly will endorse the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Working Group, including the request for the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea to provide support for the Regular Process. The Secretary-General is requested to establish a voluntary trust fund for the purpose of supporting the operations of the first five-year cycle of the Regular Process, including the provision of assistance to experts from developing countries, as well as a special scholarship fund to support training programmes for developing countries. It is expected that the Regular Process will strengthen the regular scientific assessment of the state of the marine environment in order to enhance the scientific basis for policymaking. Finally, the tenth meeting of the Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, held in June of the current year, reviewed the mandate, objectives, achievements and shortcomings of the Process in its first nine years. The review recognized that the role of the Consultative Process was unique in promoting comprehensive discussion of issues related to oceans and the law of the sea, consistent with the framework provided by the Convention and chapter 17 of Agenda 21. It also recognized that perspectives based on the three pillars of sustainable development should be integrated further in the examination of selected topics. 7 The need to strengthen and improve the efficiency of the Consultative Process was also recognized during the review. It was recommended that the Consultative Process devise a transparent, objective and inclusive process for the selection of topics and panellists, so as to facilitate the work of the General Assembly during the informal consultations on the annual draft resolution on oceans and the law of the sea. It is proposed that at its eleventh meeting the Informal Consultative Process focus on capacity- building in ocean affairs and the law of the sea, including marine science. With that important topic, which reflects the concerns of developing countries, it is hoped that the Informal Consultative Process will reinstate its original intent, further promote the sharing of knowledge, the exchange of views among the multiple stakeholders and coordination among competent agencies, and enhance awareness of the topics, including emerging issues, while promoting the three pillars of sustainable development. In that context, our approach to climate change should be focused on the conservation of blue carbon sinks. In concluding my presentation of this important draft resolution, I wish to recognize the efforts of all the delegations involved in the consultations, the high level of expertise, the professionalism and the cooperative spirit that enabled this outcome before the General Assembly today.

The Group would like to thank in particular the two coordinators of the draft resolutions on oceans and the law of the sea (A/64/L.18) and on sustainable fisheries (A/64/L.29), as well as the experts of the Member States, for the professionalism that they have demonstrated, which has facilitated the drafting and finalization of the two omnibus draft resolutions. The Group would also like to thank the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea and its specialized institutions for the key role that they play in implementing the rules of the law of the sea and its relevant resolutions. The two draft resolutions before the General Assembly today, it must be remembered, are part of the framework for applying the principles contained in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which was concluded after several years of difficult negotiations among States seeking to ensure proper ocean governance and promote the sustainable development of its resources. The result of painstaking compromises among Member States, the draft resolutions take into account the various aspects of the preservation of the marine ecosystem and the controlled management of its riches. Such aspects include issues related to the environment, marine resources, biodiversity, coordination, cooperation, the settlement of disputes and capacity- building. Those are also areas where an agreed regulatory framework and a proper code of conduct make it easier to work together. Measures taken in that context help to ensure a better preservation of the oceans. Here, we confirm our full support for the noble principles set out in the draft resolutions and for those contained in previous resolutions on the same topics. However, those principles can only give rise to a sustainable development that is capable of achieving the development goals of States if a real effort is made to involve all States, in particular developing ones, specifically African coastal States, both in drafting the resolutions and in implementing the principles. Indeed, those States, because they lack the logistical and technical resources and qualified personnel, watch powerlessly as their maritime areas are illegally and anarchically exploited, including those over which they have sovereignty under international law. The vessels and trawlers of the large fishing companies have abandoned the fishing zones of States that have the resources to monitor their coasts to happily descend on the African coast, where they 8 indulge in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, thus overexploiting Africa\\u2019s maritime resources. That illegal fishing, which African States have no way of stopping, will eventually wipe out the efforts of the international community to protect several endangered species. Given that situation, the African Group strongly believes that there is an urgent need for the international community to pay greater attention to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, so as to make all fishing practices comply with international laws governing that area. That applies in particular to fishing activities along the African coast, so that we can preserve our fish stocks and protect them from exploitation, which will lead inevitably to their reduction, and even their disappearance. For the situation is such that, if nothing is done, the legal and institutional structure established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea might well succumb to the law of the jungle. It is also vital that the international community provide the necessary assistance to developing coastal States in order to build up their capacity at the national, subregional and regional levels so that they can control their territorial waters and those beyond and prevent and fight against crime and other illicit activities, such as illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, bottom sea trawling, piracy, drug trafficking and trafficking in persons, and so forth. It is also important that States and relevant organizations, international agencies and bodies cooperate in order to strengthen the capacity of developing countries in the area of marine sciences, monitoring and evaluation of the marine environment, particularly by organizing workshops and providing necessary training and teaching materials, as well as grants for experts from developing countries. Similarly, the African Group would like to call on States and international organizations to contribute to efforts aimed at ensuring that experts from African countries can participate, especially in the various meetings concerning oceans and the law of the sea, particularly by making regular and adequate contributions to the trust fund set up to help developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, small island developing States and landlocked developing countries. The African Group attaches major importance to issues related to the protection of the marine environment, and the preservation of the marine ecosystem and marine biodiversity, from any negative impact, particularly those due to climate change. In this area, the African Group is actively involved in negotiations on draft resolutions concerning fisheries, the oceans and the law of the sea, not merely to strengthen action against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, but, above all, to combat practices that might lead to destruction of the ocean floor and have a deleterious effect on the life of the seabed and its resources. To the same end, the African Group encourages greater cooperation between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and regional fisheries organizations, in order to promote effective implementation of the FAO International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter, and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing. For Africa, the issue of the limits of the continental shelf is still unresolved, despite efforts by the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf to find appropriate solutions to the problems this raises. In this context, the African Group welcomes the Commission\\u2019s efforts to facilitate implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea relating to the delineation by coastal States of the outer limits of their continental shelf, in accordance with paragraph 8 of article 76 of the Convention. The African Group would, however, like to express its concern over the workload of the Commission. It makes scheduling meetings to consider reports submitted by coastal States a difficult challenge. This situation is seriously prejudicial for developing States, especially those that have agreed to enormous sacrifices in order to invest in the framework of the delineation process. At this rate, the African Group believes that several developing States have no chance of meeting the deadlines set by the Convention for delineating the continental shelf beyond the 200-nautical-mile mark. As a result, in order to comply with the spirit and the letter of the Convention, the African Group strongly encourages delegations to be proactive in seeking practical and realistic solutions to this important problem. As can be seen, the challenges to be dealt with in implementing the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea are still huge, and the rather impressive 9 size of the draft resolution before us (A/64/L.18 and Corr.1) gives an idea of the enormous amount of work still to be done. That cannot be achieved without the effective solidarity and efficient cooperation of every State. \",\n\"{'Action': 7.771092782604683e-07, 'ActionObject': 9.262558364753204e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 1.3725043572776485e-06, 'Body': 1.7205556090971186e-08, 'Clarification': 8.799908073342522e-07, 'Conclusion': 9.471128947780016e-08, 'Election': 8.614096032033558e-07, 'General': 0.9999821186065674, 'Introduction': 1.3249466519482667e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.7850327083124284e-07, 'MeetingLocation': 3.0837776421321905e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 7.321932571358047e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 4.939185600960627e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 2.8468869572861877e-07, 'OralStatement': 3.359300990268821e-06, 'PresidingOfficer': 9.638294073965881e-08, 'RVRequested': 8.634303050314429e-09, 'RVTaken': 4.722393143197223e-08, 'Session': 1.0200845679264603e-07, 'Sponsorship': 2.531865845867287e-07, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.656861965988355e-07, 'Vote': 8.073120483231833e-08, 'VotingIntention': 1.6503164488312905e-06}\",\n[[\"Zinsou\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Benin\", \"UNPE\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"draft resolutions\", \"DR\"], [\"A/64/L.18\", \"L\"], [\"A/64/L.29\", \"L\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"draft resolutions\", \"DR\"], [\"two draft resolutions\", \"DR\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"several years\", \"DATE\"], [\"draft resolutions\", \"DR\"], [\"draft resolutions\", \"DR\"], [\"8\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"draft resolutions\", \"DR\"], [\"paragraph 8\", \"PARA\"], [\"impressive 9\", \"PARA\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"A/64/L.18\", \"L\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 255,\n            'f': \"255\",\n        },\n\"A_64_PV.56-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 19,\n            'f': \"19\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999871253967285,\n            'f': \"0.9999871253967285\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Wolfe (Jamaica): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the 14 member States of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM): Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and my own country, Jamaica. CARICOM continues to attach great importance to our participation in the annual debates in the General Assembly on the item relating to oceans and the law of the sea. In this regard, we welcome the very comprehensive and detailed reports prepared by the Secretary-General, as contained in documents A/64/66 and Add.1 and 2. It is useful to recall that one of the principal objectives and guiding principles of the historic 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) was the commitment by States parties to, inter alia, \\u201cpromote the peaceful uses of the seas and oceans, the equitable and efficient utilization of their resources, and the study, protection and preservation of the marine environment\\u201d. (UNCLOS, preamble). These cardinal principles, together with the main provisions of the Convention, remain as relevant today as they were 27 years ago, when the Convention was adopted, and should therefore be embraced by the entire international community. As a group of small and vulnerable island developing States, CARICOM remains highly dependent on the Caribbean Sea for its commercial activities and economic livelihood, including tourism, fishing and fisheries, and the exploitation of oil and gas resources, as well as for regional and international trade, most of which is facilitated by ocean freight and international shipping arrangements. Indeed, as the Secretary-General has highlighted in his report, maritime transport remains vital to the world economy, given that more than 80 percent of international trade by volume is carried by sea, and also bearing in mind that an even higher percentage of developing-country trade is carried by ships. For those and other reasons, CARICOM member States remain firmly committed to the protection and preservation of the Caribbean Sea, with the support of the international community and with a view to achieving sustainable development. It has long been established that the Caribbean is the most tourism- dependent region in the world, relative to its size, and the Caribbean Sea, in comparison to other large marine ecosystems, is surrounded by the largest number of countries in the world. CARICOM therefore welcomes the renewed emphasis on efforts to heighten global awareness of the current challenges faced by the international community in sustainable ocean management and on the future prospects and challenges in the implementation of the regime established by the Convention on the Law of the Sea for the protection and preservation of the marine environment. These issues must be addressed in the context of the current challenges faced by Caribbean and other developing countries, as a result of the high degree of vulnerability occasioned by climate change and the consequent rise in sea level, as well as the increase in the frequency and intensity of national disasters caused by hurricanes, floods and drought that our region has experienced in recent years. In this regard, we view marine scientific research as essential to our efforts to confront the challenges to the marine environment. We therefore welcome the revision of the guide on marine scientific research prepared by the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea. This guide will be useful in assisting developing countries in examining best practices as we strive to conduct research in our respective maritime zones. CARICOM reiterates its position that safe, secure and crime-free routes for navigation and the implementation of international rules and standards for improving marine safety and security must underpin the core of a comprehensive programme aimed at protecting marine trade, and at combating, in accordance with international law, threats to maritime security. We therefore remain concerned at the alarming increase in the number of committed and attempted 10 acts of piracy and armed robbery against ships, reported to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), which, in the first six months of 2009 alone, totalled 238, as compared with 121 in the first six months of 2008, as indicated in the Secretary-General\\u2019s report (A/64/66/Add.1). The international community must remain resolute in addressing that scourge, which has the potential to cause severe disruptions to maritime commerce. At the twelfth meeting of the Council on Foreign and Community Relations (COFCOR), held in Kingston, Jamaica, in May this year, CARICOM expressed its concern at that grave phenomenon, which affects Caribbean countries that are flag registers, while also noting that the Caribbean Sea is recognized as a major shipping route and that robbery at sea is not unknown in the Caribbean and the South Atlantic and could have a negative impact on CARICOM States. As a result, CARICOM members have agreed to collaborate effectively in relevant international forums to share information and strategize jointly so as to have a strong voice in the international dialogue on the issue of piracy. It was also agreed that those CARICOM States that enjoy membership in the IMO will cooperate in drafting domestic legislation to tackle the problem and would forward such drafts to the Legal Committee of the IMO in order to facilitate the drafting of model legislation relevant to piracy and related issues. CARICOM also continues to face serious security threats posed by the maritime traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, coupled with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, which continue to pose serious challenges for Governments and law enforcement agencies in our region. We have devised regional strategies aimed at addressing that illegal trade and its associated crimes, which are at variance with the provisions of the Convention on the Law of the Sea and the stipulations for peaceful uses of the sea, and we are committed to working with agencies such as the Commission on Narcotic Drugs to confront those serious crimes. Another perennial concern for CARICOM States is the danger posed by the transport of radioactive materials through the Caribbean Sea. While recognizing the principles of freedom of navigation enshrined in the relevant provisions of the Convention, we remain deeply disturbed at the potential risk to lives, health, and our environment and economies in the event of an accident during the transportation of radioactive materials by sea. We wish to reiterate that States involved in the transport of such hazardous materials have a legal obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment and we call upon them to continue to adhere to the guidelines established by the International Atomic Energy Agency and other agencies on the transportation of such materials. Turning to other issues under our consideration, CARICOM takes this opportunity to re-emphasize its support for the work of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS). We are encouraged by the important contribution that the CLCS continues to make with respect to the submissions made by coastal States seeking to extend the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles in accordance with article 76, paragraph 8, of the Convention. As of 12 May 2009, the workload of the CLCS has increased due to the 51 submissions lodged by coastal States. The Chairman of the Commission has reported that, given its current workload and the resource constraints, new strategies would have to be employed if the Commission is to make recommendations to coastal States within a reasonable time, so that the submitting States can establish the limits of their continental shelf as provided under article 76. We thus call on Member States to participate in the informal working group established by the nineteenth Meeting of States Parties, which has been mandated to devise strategies aimed at streamlining the work of the Commission. It is our view that States need to commit to providing more resources to the Commission, including to the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, which serves as its Secretariat, at this critical period, if the Organization is to effectively discharge its mandate. CARICOM also calls on States that are in a position to do so to contribute to the Trust Fund established by General Assembly resolution 55/7 to assist members of the Commission from developing countries in participating in the work of the Commission. CARICOM also wishes to commend the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for the important action undertaken to enhance the quality of 11 its work with the establishment of a new Chamber for Maritime Delimitation Disputes, as well as the modification of the Chamber for Fisheries Disputes and the Chamber for Maritime Environment Disputes. The pacific settlement of disputes is a hallmark in the international law of the sea and we urge States parties to make declarations under article 287 of the Convention, accepting the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in settling disputes concerning the interpretation and application of the provisions of the Convention. As part of the CARICOM family, Jamaica continues to fulfil its legal obligations as host country for the headquarters of the International Seabed Authority, which has been entrusted with the mandate to administer, organize and control activities in the international seabed area on behalf of States parties. CARICOM is pleased at the considerable progress achieved by the Authority over the past two years, towards the finalization of the draft on prospecting and exploration for polymetallic sulphides in the Area. We remain reasonably confident that the draft regulations can be concluded at the upcoming sixteenth session of the Authority, to be held from 26 April to 7 May 2010. At that session, the Council of the Authority will also have before it the draft regulations on prospecting and exploration for cobalt- rich ferromanganese crusts in the Area, which were adopted by the Legal and Technical Commission during the fifteenth session. CARICOM therefore wishes to emphasize the urgent need for improvement in attendance at the meetings of the Authority, particularly at this critical juncture when we are in the process of finalizing legal codes for prospecting and exploration of mineral resources that are part of the common heritage of humanity. Improved attendance would also serve to reemphasize the pre-eminent role of the Authority as the sole legitimate body that has the mandate to act on behalf of the international community in this important maritime zone. It should be noted that the role of the Authority is assuming greater importance at a time when the Commission has made recommendations to some coastal States allowing them to establish their continental shelf jurisdiction beyond 200 nautical miles. As a result of such action by the Commission, the Authority will now have a more definitive position as to those areas where national jurisdiction ends and 12 where its own mandate begins, that is, to manage the international seabed regime. An institution as important as the Authority must be endowed with competent leadership for it to garner confidence among its membership. It is for this reason that we are very pleased to welcome the presence in the General Assembly this morning of His Excellency Nii Allotey Odunton, who was elected Secretary-General on 4 June 2008 at the Authority\\u2019s fourteenth session and whose term of office formally commenced in January of this year. With more than 20 years of experience in the international civil service, particularly in the area of marine mineral resources and marine resource policy formulation, Mr. Odunton brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to his new post. CARICOM is therefore confident that he will harness all of his multiple talents to enable the Authority to be a true custodian of our common heritage. In conclusion, CARICOM urges those States members of the Authority that are not yet parties to the 1994 Agreement relating to the Implementation of Part XI of the Convention immediately to take steps towards becoming parties so as to remove the incongruity and anomaly that currently exist for those States. \",\n\"{'Action': 5.035716981183214e-07, 'ActionObject': 3.996136683781515e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 1.1621843896136852e-06, 'Body': 1.1148172163188974e-08, 'Clarification': 7.921373708086321e-07, 'Conclusion': 1.0480097500931151e-07, 'Election': 3.0681843554702937e-07, 'General': 0.9999871253967285, 'Introduction': 2.380845671723364e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 9.502932840632639e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 3.023625367859495e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 4.905500361473969e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 2.5437777821935015e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 2.7577405603551597e-07, 'OralStatement': 1.5374138229162781e-06, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.341728079751192e-07, 'RVRequested': 6.1039653331818045e-09, 'RVTaken': 2.9705731208196084e-08, 'Session': 5.5407074484037366e-08, 'Sponsorship': 9.76848752998194e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.3509333857418824e-07, 'Vote': 6.070020930337705e-08, 'VotingIntention': 1.8699987549553043e-06}\",\n[[\"Wolfe\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Jamaica\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"14\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Antigua and Barbuda\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Bahamas\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Barbados\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Belize\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Dominica\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Grenada\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Guyana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Haiti\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Suriname\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Trinidad and Tobago\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Jamaica\", \"UNPE\"], [\"annual\", \"DATE\"], [\"A/64/66\", \"Symbol\"], [\"2\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"1982\", \"DATE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"27 years ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"recent years\", \"DATE\"], [\"10\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the first six months of 2009\", \"DATE\"], [\"238\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"121\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the first six months of 2008\", \"DATE\"], [\"A/64/66/Add.1\", \"Symbol\"], [\"twelfth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Jamaica\", \"UNPE\"], [\"May this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"CLCS\", \"PERSON\"], [\"200\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"article 76\", \"DATE\"], [\"paragraph 8\", \"PARA\"], [\"12\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"51\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"nineteenth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"resolution 55/7\", \"R\"], [\"11\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Jamaica\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"past two\", \"PARA\"], [\"sixteenth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"26 April to 7 May 2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"fifteenth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"12\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"this morning\", \"TIME\"], [\"Nii Allotey Odunton\", \"PERSON\"], [\"4 June 2008\", \"DATE\"], [\"fourteenth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"January of this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"more than 20 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Odunton\", \"PERSON\"], [\"1994\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 256,\n            'f': \"256\",\n        },\n\"A_64_PV.56-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 20,\n            'f': \"20\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999958276748657,\n            'f': \"0.9999958276748657\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Valero Brice\\u00f1o (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela), Vice-President, took the Chair.

Finally, we take this opportunity to once again urge those States that have not yet become parties to the Convention to do so with a view to ensuring its universal acceptance. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.517593887001567e-06, 'ActionObject': 4.9219156750268667e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 4.059305069858965e-08, 'Body': 1.4995935604389388e-09, 'Clarification': 2.9077591534587555e-07, 'Conclusion': 2.4595385728076735e-09, 'Election': 8.890943803407936e-08, 'General': 0.9999958276748657, 'Introduction': 1.565067861974967e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 6.680699726757666e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 9.785355814528884e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 2.344697547229657e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 9.310806348139522e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 1.2641592661566392e-07, 'OralStatement': 4.712175893928361e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 7.9617223036621e-08, 'RVRequested': 7.634914228615841e-11, 'RVTaken': 3.526528180586297e-09, 'Session': 6.408142905200975e-09, 'Sponsorship': 3.828420602758342e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.365489646967035e-07, 'Vote': 2.7856046358465392e-08, 'VotingIntention': 6.961010399209044e-07}\",\n[[\"Valero Brice\\u00f1o\", \"PERSON\"], [\"31 August 2009\", \"DATE\"], [\"159\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"three\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the previous year\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 257,\n            'f': \"257\",\n        },\n\"A_64_PV.56-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 21,\n            'f': \"21\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999926090240479,\n            'f': \"0.9999926090240479\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Moses (Nauru): I have to honour to speak on behalf of the Pacific small island developing States (SIDS) represented at the United Nations, namely, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Tonga, Vanuatu and my own country, Nauru. To the Pacific SIDS as island nations, the robustness of the international ocean governance is of critical concern. Not only is the ocean an integral part of our cultural identity, but we rely on the oceans as a major source of our food. Negative impacts on the health of marine ecosystems threaten the very ability of our people to meet their nutritional needs. Healthy ecosystems are also critical to tourism, which is a major source of revenue for many of our islands. The sustainable management of our marine ecosystem is essential to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. All nations are beneficiaries of the rich resources provided by the oceans, and all nations have the responsibility to ensure the sustainable conservation and management of marine resources. The Pacific regional waters compose 10 per cent of the Earth\\u2019s surface, and much of this falls within the national jurisdictions of the small island developing States. We take our role as custodians of the precious ecosystems seriously. Our region has a high concentration of vulnerable marine ecosystems, including coral reefs, hydrothermal vents and underwater seamounts. The Pacific Ocean is also home to fish stocks of global importance. Our oceans are under threat. The human impacts on the health of marine biodiversity are profound. Fish stocks continue to fall, and scientists warn that global fisheries are in crisis. Illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing is one of the gravest threats to the future sustainability of our regional marine resources and the marine environment. The rate of IUU fishing in the Pacific is higher than in any other region, accounting for approximately 36 per cent of the total catch. IUU fishing has severe impacts on target species and by-catch, both affecting subsistence fishing by Pacific people and having severe negative impacts on biodiversity. The Pacific SIDS face serious constraints in their ability to respond to IUU fishing in our region because of geographic isolation, small populations and lack of technical expertise. We call on all countries to continue and increase their efforts to end IUU fishing, and we welcome the assistance provided to us by our partners, particularly in relation to joint enforcement exercises. We would like to strengthen these initiatives. Bottom trawling is gravely endangering vulnerable ecosystems. We welcome the review of the implementation of resolution 61/105 that took place in September, particularly on the issue of bottom trawling. Progress was made in strengthening the measures, and we consider this year\\u2019s draft resolution (A/64/L.29) a genuine step in the right direction towards greater conservation and management of deep- sea fish stocks, habitats and ecosystems. We strongly welcome the provisions calling upon flag States and regional fisheries management organizations not to authorize bottom trawling until the requirements in resolution 61/105 have been met, and we will exercise our own role as participants in the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organization process to ensure that the high-seas pockets enclosed by our exclusive economic zones in the western tropical Pacific are not threatened by bottom trawling. We wish to reiterate the call on those States participating in negotiations to establish a new regional fisheries management organization for the North Pacific to expedite their negotiations and to ensure that there is no gap between the areas covered by the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organization and the measures implemented for the North Pacific. We repeat our call for a prohibition on destructive fishing practices, including bottom trawling, where there is no regional fisheries management organization under negotiation or interim measures in effect, until appropriate conservation and management measures are in place. We wish to thank all parties in the negotiations for their constructive work in addressing the serious threats of bottom trawling, but we remind them that further urgent work remains to be done to ensure the sustainability of our oceans. We look forward to further review of the actions of States and regional fisheries management organizations to implement resolution 61/105 and this year\\u2019s draft resolution in 2011, and we hope that improvements in implementation will be reported. Climate change is having severe impacts on our oceans, and we regret that this serious issue has received too little practical attention from the international community. The importance of our oceans in regulating the global atmosphere has been largely taken for granted. The oceans have absorbed over 50 per cent of all anthropogenic carbon emissions over the past 200 years, and thus have a significant role to play in mitigating climate change. Yet the high level of carbon dioxide absorbed by our oceans is having severe negative impacts on the health and functioning of marine ecosystems. Higher 13 levels of carbon dioxide are causing acidification, affecting the growth and viability of many marine organisms, and threatening acute changes in the food web and effects on fish stocks. Coral reefs are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification, as higher acid levels prevent coral growth. It is estimated that corals around the world will stop growing if the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration stabilizes at 450 parts per million, with unknown but likely profound negative impacts on dependent species. In light of these impacts, we reiterate our call for the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen to conclude with an agreement with emission targets that limit atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration at 350 parts per million and keep global temperature rise well below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Finally, the delineation of continental shelves is a critical issue for the Pacific SIDS. It is imperative that a solution be found for the inadequate resources so that the work is able to progress in a timely manner. The current timeframes are severely disadvantageous for smaller missions relying on external advice to navigate the highly technical issues involved. \",\n\"{'Action': 5.359755164136004e-07, 'ActionObject': 1.8499041232189484e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 5.440957124847046e-07, 'Body': 6.30627150499663e-09, 'Clarification': 4.3341790956219484e-07, 'Conclusion': 3.783502933174532e-08, 'Election': 3.756317425995803e-07, 'General': 0.9999926090240479, 'Introduction': 3.996783561888151e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 5.509953737714568e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 1.6984223805138754e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 2.8024302878293383e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 1.319801299359824e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 1.9154752806116448e-07, 'OralStatement': 1.727283461150364e-06, 'PresidingOfficer': 6.735182012107543e-08, 'RVRequested': 2.1062012134365204e-09, 'RVTaken': 1.9272857088026285e-08, 'Session': 7.156474879366215e-08, 'Sponsorship': 7.108751276518888e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 7.049557382288185e-08, 'Vote': 4.024400368507486e-08, 'VotingIntention': 7.835649853404902e-07}\",\n[[\"Moses\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Nauru\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"the Federated States of Micronesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Fiji\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Palau\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Papua New Guinea\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the Republic of the Marshall Islands\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Samoa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Solomon Islands\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Tuvalu\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Tonga\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Vanuatu\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Nauru\", \"UNPE\"], [\"approximately 36\", \"PARA\"], [\"resolution 61/105\", \"R\"], [\"September\", \"DATE\"], [\"this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"A/64/L.29\", \"L\"], [\"resolution 61/105\", \"R\"], [\"resolution 61/105\", \"R\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"2011\", \"DATE\"], [\"past 200\", \"PARA\"], [\"13\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"450\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"million\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"350\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"million\", \"CARDINAL\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 258,\n            'f': \"258\",\n        },\n\"A_64_PV.56-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 22,\n            'f': \"22\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9990566372871399,\n            'f': \"0.9990566372871399\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Negm (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, the delegation of Egypt aligns itself with the statement delivered by the representative of Benin on behalf of the African Group. It also expresses its appreciation to the coordinators of the draft resolutions on oceans and the law of the sea (A/64/L.18) and sustainable fisheries (A/64/L.29) for their efforts to reach agreement on the two drafts resolutions. The delegation of Egypt attaches particular importance to the role of these drafts in promoting international cooperation in matters relating to the seas and oceans, the protection of the marine environment and the sustainability of fisheries for the benefit of humanity, in accordance with the principles of international law enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982. Furthermore, we thank the Secretary-General and the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for their efforts in preparing the reports before us today. From this perspective, the Egyptian delegation stresses the importance of strengthening the efforts of the international community in the field of marine scientific research, particularly in the context of the International Seabed Authority and the study of the effects of mining activities on the seabed environment. It also stresses the importance of following the new guidelines to prevent the monopolization of mineral exploitation of those areas, as they represent the common heritage of humankind. Similarly, the Egyptian delegation is deeply concerned over the increasing impact of climate change on marine life and ecosystems and on shipping routes and the associated increased costs of maritime transport. It also stresses the need to take these issues into account in the current negotiations in Copenhagen on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Turning to the safety and security of navigation, the Egyptian delegation further expresses its growing concern at the rising number of incidents involving piracy and armed robbery against ships, especially in the waters off the coast of East Africa. Egypt supports international efforts to combat this phenomenon, particularly off the coast of Somalia. In this regard, it welcomes the recognition in draft resolution A/64/L.18 on oceans and the law of the sea of the importance of reaching a comprehensive and permanent settlement of the situation in Somalia, which is closely linked to the spread of piracy in that region. Aware of the need to promote international cooperation in this regard, Egypt is participating actively in the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia with a view to reaching a comprehensive solution to this problem. Furthermore, my delegation emphasizes the need to implement the Djibouti Code of Conduct concerning the Repression of Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in the Western Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden, and urges everyone to work to improve conditions for seafarers and fishermen victims of piracy. Hence, it welcomes the Assembly\\u2019s request of the International Maritime Organization and the International Labour Organization to study ways to achieve this. The Egyptian delegation is also closely following international efforts being made with international shipping companies to allow the transport of radioactive materials in accordance with the relevant international protection measures on the transfer of such materials for peaceful purposes and medical use and in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. From the same perspective, the Egyptian delegation stresses the importance of providing the necessary support to developing countries to ensure 14 their increased participation in data collection programmes and exchanges in various fields related to marine and ocean sciences. It also deems it necessary to solve the problem of the increasing workload of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf in order to enable it to consider the recent submissions of developing countries on an equal footing with the past submissions of developed countries. With regard to the United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, the Egyptian delegation welcomes the results of the tenth meeting, which emphasized the need to strengthen the pillars of sustainable development when considering topics consistent with the legal framework of the Convention in order to achieve the goals of Agenda 21, which established this process. The Egyptian delegation looks forward to achieving this goal through the future activities of the Consultative Process. As for sustainable fisheries, the Egyptian delegation emphasizes the need for greater efforts to protect endangered fish species, fight illegal, unregistered and unreported fishing and eliminate destructive fishing practices affecting the seabed. In this regard, the Egyptian delegation has monitored measures taken by regional fishery management organizations to protect seabed ecosystems in implementation of resolution 61/105. However, we note the inadequacy of these measures to ensuring the sustainable use of marine resources and habitats, including vulnerable marine ecosystems, and look forward to the enhanced cooperation of States with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and regional fisheries management organizations in creating a system to manage seabed fishing in a manner that preserves the marine ecosystems. Also, in order to strengthen international cooperation on sustainable fisheries, the Egyptian delegation proposes that the 2010 Review Conference on the 1995 Fish Stocks Agreement address the problems in the Agreement that are preventing ratification by more countries, especially the developing ones, and the establishment of effective fisheries management mechanisms. Finally, the Egyptian delegation expresses its growing concern over the state of the oceans and seas worldwide and looks forward to greater cooperation efforts by the international community to improve these conditions and to protect the marine environment from factors that harm marine biodiversity and vulnerable marine ecosystems. \",\n\"{'Action': 2.862114115487202e-06, 'ActionObject': 2.614159257063875e-06, 'AgendaStatus': 2.6270059606758878e-05, 'Body': 4.251791949627659e-07, 'Clarification': 4.554502083919942e-06, 'Conclusion': 4.936968252877705e-06, 'Election': 3.8043406220822362e-06, 'General': 0.9990566372871399, 'Introduction': 9.988011879613623e-05, 'MeetingDateTime': 4.2542828282421397e-07, 'MeetingLocation': 4.97407563671004e-06, 'MeetingNumber': 1.726739924379217e-06, 'MeetingSegment': 0.0007311906083486974, 'MeetingStatus': 1.5463406271010172e-06, 'OralStatement': 1.3294316886458546e-05, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.3311056363818352e-06, 'RVRequested': 4.4150294797873357e-07, 'RVTaken': 1.1383834817024763e-06, 'Session': 1.3753830216955976e-06, 'Sponsorship': 1.7332733932562405e-06, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 5.888277883059345e-06, 'Vote': 5.122569177729019e-07, 'VotingIntention': 3.229947469662875e-05}\",\n[[\"Negm\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Egypt\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Egypt\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Benin\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"draft resolutions\", \"DR\"], [\"A/64/L.18\", \"L\"], [\"A/64/L.29\", \"L\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"drafts resolutions\", \"DR\"], [\"Egypt\", \"UNPE\"], [\"1982\", \"DATE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Egypt\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Somalia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"draft resolution A/64/L.18\", \"DR\"], [\"Somalia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Egypt\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Somalia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Djibouti\", \"UNPE\"], [\"14\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"tenth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"resolution 61/105\", \"R\"], [\"1995\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 259,\n            'f': \"259\",\n        },\n\"A_64_PV.56-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 23,\n            'f': \"23\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999980926513672,\n            'f': \"0.9999980926513672\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Picco (Monaco) (spoke in French): We have probably reached the maximum potential of capture fishing in the planet\\u2019s oceans. In 2007, almost 28 per cent of fish stocks were overexploited, exhausted or in the process of reconstitution. Migratory species, whales and other cetaceans are still vulnerable to chemical pollution, collision with ships, exploitation, sound pollution, by-catch, ingestion of marine waste and the effects of climate change. Marine ecosystems, which scientific research has confirmed as important carbon sinks, are suffering from those devastating impacts and disappearing. Ocean acidification due to climate change threatens the livelihoods of billions of people throughout the world. Acidification leads to erosion and jeopardizes the stability of coastal areas. Its economic and social impact, aggravated by extreme climatic phenomena, is potentially devastating. Although knowledge of marine diversity remains insufficient, as demonstrated by the fact that over 1,000 species are discovered every year, progress in research confirms the essential role of marine life and biodiversity in preserving the world\\u2019s ecosystems and ensuring socio-economic development. Healthy oceans are a tool against poverty and hunger, can ensure food security and are essential to attaining our common goal of sustainable development. At this moment when our heads of State and Government are preparing to negotiate a critical political agreement in Copenhagen, it is deplorable that no reference is made to that event in the omnibus resolution (A/64/L.18), in particular due to the fact that the General Assembly is preparing to devote special attention to biodiversity within the context of the 2010 International Year of Biodiversity. In addition to developing further methods to adapt to climate change, necessary to strengthening the resilience of marine ecosystems, the international community also has a collective duty to act and to take greater care in preserving and managing the living marine resources, pursuant to its obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. 15 The personal commitment of His Serene Highness Prince Albert II is reflected in concrete steps to protect fragile ecosystems such as coral reefs, which are home to 30 per cent of marine biodiversity and are under unprecedented stress. In that connection, I should like to announce that, from 12 to 15 January 2010, Monaco will host the General Meeting of the International Coral Reef Initiative. That commitment is also behind the Principality of Monaco\\u2019s efforts with regard to threatened species such as the bluefin tuna, which is one of the world\\u2019s most exploited species. It is for that reason that the Principality has acted to have the bluefin tuna placed on the Appendix I list of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), with a view to banning the international trade in that species, preventing the collapse of stocks and avoiding its extinction. In our opinion, the 13,500 ton limit just adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) for the 2010 fishing season will not guarantee the rehabilitation of that overexploited species, especially in the Mediterranean. We therefore appeal to all countries that share this world heritage, in particular CITES States parties, to fully assume their responsibilities \\u2014 failing which, the industries that benefit from trade in this species will disappear with it. Moreover, unreported and illegal fishing makes it impossible to bring international trade back under control. In that regard, we should promote active cooperation between ICCAT and CITES. In addition, Monaco welcomes the recent adoption, during the thirty-sixth session of the Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization, of a treaty aimed at prohibiting access to fishing ports by vessels involved in illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing. Monaco also continues to be very concerned about large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing, despite the fact that it was officially banned many years ago, as well as by the devastating impact of bottom trawling on marine ecosystems. The third meeting of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working Group to study issues relating to the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction should promote efforts in the areas of research, coordination, the management of protected marine areas and 16 environmental impact assessment procedures. Its experience will continue to be useful in improving protection for deep-sea and pelagic areas. On the eve of the deadline we set ourselves at the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development for putting in place an ecosystem-based approach, and in line with our obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Convention on Biological Diversity, it is crucial that we establish representative networks for protected marine areas so as to preserve their ecological and biological wealth. Regional intergovernmental processes must also be strengthened. Against that backdrop, and with a view to the establishment of a regulatory mechanism, it would seem essential to develop both marine evaluation capabilities and capacities that are primarily based on better scientific understanding. \",\n\"{'Action': 8.97504719432618e-08, 'ActionObject': 2.1626481938596953e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 1.207006192771587e-07, 'Body': 1.0820759843710448e-09, 'Clarification': 1.2837575980029214e-07, 'Conclusion': 1.4739598874768944e-08, 'Election': 1.4815763904607593e-07, 'General': 0.9999980926513672, 'Introduction': 4.235800474816642e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.1279173978427934e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 6.567687904635022e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 8.554837727103859e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 2.666649265847809e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 4.78271253712137e-08, 'OralStatement': 9.420671176485484e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.8498645221475272e-08, 'RVRequested': 8.30068014323615e-10, 'RVTaken': 4.2730707860982875e-09, 'Session': 2.1753322698714328e-08, 'Sponsorship': 2.1326796328935416e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.254320818906308e-08, 'Vote': 7.220324249601617e-08, 'VotingIntention': 3.1821431889511587e-07}\",\n[[\"Picco\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Monaco\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2007\", \"DATE\"], [\"almost 28\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"billions\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"over 1,000\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"every year\", \"DATE\"], [\"A/64/L.18\", \"L\"], [\"15\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Albert II\", \"PERSON\"], [\"12 to 15 January 2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"Monaco\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the Principality of Monaco\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Flora\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the 2010 fishing season\", \"DATE\"], [\"Monaco\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Monaco\", \"UNPE\"], [\"many years ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"third\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"16\", \"CARDINAL\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 260,\n            'f': \"260\",\n        },\n\"A_64_PV.56-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 24,\n            'f': \"24\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999773502349854,\n            'f': \"0.9999773502349854\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Wetland (Norway): Next week, the attention of the international community will be directed towards the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. The effects and impacts of climate change are evident to all of us, and we need to respond urgently. We hope that the Conference will have the necessary momentum and that the parties will show the necessary political will and flexibility so that concrete results can be achieved. The consequences of climate change are especially visible and measurable in the Arctic. If ice- melting continues and the polar ice cap continues to diminish, new opportunities to exploit previously inaccessible resources and new shipping routes will emerge. We will thus face the challenge of balancing the protection of the Arctic environment with the orderly and sustainable use of its resources. The five Arctic Ocean coastal States \\u2014 Canada, Denmark, the Russian Federation, the United States and Norway \\u2014 have a special responsibility in that regard. In last year\\u2019s Ilulissat Declaration, they expressed readiness to stand by their special responsibilities on the basis of the extensive international legal framework that applies to the Arctic Ocean, such as the law of the sea. Under the Arctic Council, negotiations on an international instrument regarding search and rescue in the Arctic will commence next month. In the International Maritime Organization (IMO), we are working to strengthen the guidelines for ships operating in ice-covered waters \\u2014 the so-called polar code. We attach great importance to that work in the IMO, and we count on the active support of all Member States to make sure that a mandate for a revision can be agreed upon in the meeting of IMO Subcommittee on Ship Design and Equipment in February 2010. This year\\u2019s negotiations on the General Assembly draft resolution on sustainable fisheries (A/64/L.29) included a review of resolution 61/105, of 2006, which, inter alia, encourages States to take action to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems from destructive fishing practices. Norway has worked actively to promote action against the use of fishing gear that may harm marine biodiversity. We have done so in the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission, the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. We also played an active part in the development of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) International Guidelines for the Management of Deep-Sea Fisheries in the High Seas. This year\\u2019s review and the Secretary-General\\u2019s report on the issue (A/64/305) show that States have taken significant measures to implement the 2006 resolution. However, it is also clear that considerable work remains to be done in order to offer vulnerable ecosystems the necessary protection. We are happy that both those points are reflected in the draft resolution. The goals set out are ambitious, and they need to be in order to prevent further damage from the use of destructive fishing practices. States and regional fisheries management organizations must assume their full responsibility in that regard. Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing seriously undermines efforts to conserve and manage fish stocks in a sustainable manner. It is particularly harmful to developing countries. Such fishing also has severe negative effects on food security and environmental protection all over the world. An important milestone in the global fight against IUU fishing was reached last August when, in the framework of FAO, we managed to finalize the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing. Those negotiations were initiated by Norway in 2005 because we saw the need for a global approach to prevent the landing of IUU fish. The agreement was approved by the FAO Conference and signed by Norway on 22 November. This is an important instrument for better global port-State control. We encourage all States to become parties to the Agreement as soon as possible. The establishment of the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles is a central element in the implementation of the law of the sea regime. The delineation process clarifies the legal framework for future shelf activities. Such clarity also entails significant positive development implications. Norway submitted documentation concerning the limits of our continental shelf in the High North in 2006, and received the recommendations from the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf earlier this year. We were impressed by the work of the members of the Commission and I take this opportunity to commend them for their efforts. The Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea (DOALOS) also deserves praise for its contribution to the work and functioning of the Commission. States must now work together to secure for the Commission and DOALOS the resources they need to continue their work in this important field. Many developing countries face particular challenges in preparing documentation for their submissions. We heard testimony to that effect from my colleague from Nauru earlier today. States with the necessary financial and technical resources must therefore assist developing countries in the preparation of those submissions. At the eighteenth Meeting of States Parties, in June 2008, we worked actively for the decision contained in document SPLOS/183, to the effect that developing countries can submit preliminary information indicative of the outer limits of their continental shelves. Norway has also assisted 10 African States in their preparation of such preliminary information to be submitted to the Secretary-General before the deadline. In that endeavour, we had close and fruitful cooperation with the Shelf Programme of the United Nations Environment Programme, as represented by the Global Resource Information Database at Arendal, Norway, as well as with the Economic Community of West African States and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia. We also received valuable advice from the 17 United Nations Office for West Africa. We are now studying how we can best provide those African coastal States with technical and financial assistance in order to prepare full submissions to the Commission. Piracy and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden continue to threaten the people of Somalia, the whole region and a series of protective interests. Those interests include innocent lives, humanitarian supplies and international commerce and navigation. Some 1,000 Norwegian- owned ships pass through the Gulf of Aden every year. We are therefore directly affected, and are acting accordingly. We co-sponsored Security Council resolution 1897 (2009) of 30 November 2009. We highly appreciate the work of the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia, which was established in January 2009. Norway participates in the work of the four working groups under the Contact Group. In January 2010, we will chair the fifth meeting of the Contact Group itself. Norway also contributes, with one frigate, to the European Union-led Operation Atalanta in the Gulf of Aden. International cooperation to ensure security for international shipping off the coast of Somalia must continue, as must cooperation to improve the situation on land in Somalia in order to address the root causes of the problem. \",\n\"{'Action': 9.611433142708847e-07, 'ActionObject': 2.725759600252786e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 1.8852615539799444e-06, 'Body': 2.1790492965578778e-08, 'Clarification': 7.250552584991965e-07, 'Conclusion': 1.647747467359295e-07, 'Election': 1.214880740008084e-06, 'General': 0.9999773502349854, 'Introduction': 3.2037894470704487e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 8.25899917344941e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 4.7367794309138844e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 9.825215840919554e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 8.853374311001971e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 4.1802090322562435e-07, 'OralStatement': 1.2777356914739357e-06, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.4707188117645273e-07, 'RVRequested': 1.4049343022293215e-08, 'RVTaken': 6.217973691491352e-08, 'Session': 1.9442779830569634e-07, 'Sponsorship': 9.322771887809722e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.645759309416462e-07, 'Vote': 1.2519367942331883e-07, 'VotingIntention': 1.9077319848292973e-06}\",\n[[\"Wetland\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Norway\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Next week\", \"DATE\"], [\"five\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Canada\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Denmark\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the Russian Federation\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Norway\", \"UNPE\"], [\"last year\", \"DATE\"], [\"next month\", \"DATE\"], [\"February 2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"This year\", \"DATE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"A/64/L.29\", \"L\"], [\"resolution 61/105\", \"R\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"Norway\", \"UNPE\"], [\"This year\", \"DATE\"], [\"A/64/305\", \"Symbol\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"last August\", \"DATE\"], [\"Norway\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2005\", \"DATE\"], [\"Norway\", \"UNPE\"], [\"22 November\", \"DATE\"], [\"200\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Norway\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"earlier this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Nauru\", \"UNPE\"], [\"earlier today\", \"TIME\"], [\"eighteenth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"June 2008\", \"DATE\"], [\"Norway\", \"UNPE\"], [\"10\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Norway\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Somalia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"17\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Somalia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Somalia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Some 1,000\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"resolution 1897\", \"R\"], [\"2009\", \"DATE\"], [\"30\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"November 2009\", \"DATE\"], [\"Somalia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"January 2009\", \"DATE\"], [\"Norway\", \"UNPE\"], [\"four\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"January 2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"fifth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Norway\", \"UNPE\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Somalia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Somalia\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 261,\n            'f': \"261\",\n        },\n\"A_64_PV.56-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 25,\n            'f': \"25\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999288320541382,\n            'f': \"0.9999288320541382\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Nguyen Duy Chien (Viet Nam): At the outset, my delegation wishes to welcome the continued consideration by the General Assembly of the agenda item relating to developments in ocean affairs and the law of the sea. We thank the Secretary-General and the Secretariat, and in particular the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, for the reports on oceans and the law of the sea and on sustainable fisheries. We also thank the two coordinators for their hard work in conducting the negotiations on the two draft resolutions that have been introduced under this agenda item (A/64/L.18 and A/64/L.29). The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides a comprehensive and sound legal framework for all ocean issues and ocean- related activities. The nearly universal acceptance of UNCLOS by the international community is a reflection of our cherished goals of promoting the optimal use of the world\\u2019s oceans and seas in conformity with the principles of justice and equal rights. Every effort must be made to fully implement 18 UNCLOS, with due respect for the delicate balance between the rights and obligations of States contained in its provisions. Viet Nam commends the International Seabed Authority, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf for the great amount of work they have taken on in the past year. We note with satisfaction the efforts of UNCLOS States parties, especially developing countries, to fulfil their obligation to make submissions to the Commission or to inform the Commission of their intention to make submissions establishing the outer limits of their continental shelves beyond 200 miles. Viet Nam is of the view that every submission made to the Commission by States parties should be considered by the Commission in accordance with the provisions of UNCLOS. The Commission now has a clearer picture for organizing its working schedules. It will need stronger support from us to accomplish its heavy work load in the years ahead. Thanks to the flexibility shown by all regional groups of States parties, important decisions were made at the nineteenth Meeting of States Parties to UNCLOS, held in June 2009, with regard to the allocation of seats on the Commission and the Tribunal. My delegation calls on all UNCLOS States parties to adhere strictly to those decisions in the future elections to those bodies. My delegation recognizes the contribution of the Open-ended Informal Consultative Process to strengthening the annual debate of the General Assembly on oceans and the law of the sea. At the tenth meeting of the Consultative Process, Member States made great efforts in assessing the achievements and shortcomings of the past nine meetings and in recommending ways to move the Process forward. My delegation fully supports the view expressed by the Group of 77 and China that the Process should be carried out in full accordance with UNCLOS, taking into account the agreements reached at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, in particular chapter 17 of Agenda 21. Against the backdrop of this assessment of all the developments relating to oceans and the law of the sea, the Government of Viet Nam supports the two draft resolutions on which the General Assembly will take action today. As a developing coastal State that borders the South China Sea \\u2014 which is known to all Vietnamese people as the Eastern Sea \\u2014 Viet Nam attaches great importance to adopting and implementing policies that promote legitimate and sustainable uses of maritime space and resources for economic development, as provided for by UNCLOS. It is no secret that maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea not only meets the interests of the States adjacent to that important sea area, but also makes a valuable contribution to the world\\u2019s peace and security. It is therefore essential for all States in the South China Sea region to work together more closely in order to reach mutual understandings so as to make the South China Sea a peaceful and stable zone. The conclusion and implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of the Parties in the South China Sea by the member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and China constitutes a significant step in that direction. The Vietnamese Government strongly believes that the successful implementation of the Declaration and the elaboration and adoption of a code of conduct in the South China Sea that fully respects the legal framework provided by UNCLOS, will provide a more conducive environment for peace, stability and economic development in the region. For its part, the Government of Viet Nam is committed to making every effort to work with all neighbouring States for the sake of the peace, stability and prosperity of all peoples sharing the South China Sea. \",\n\"{'Action': 6.468763444900105e-07, 'ActionObject': 3.3393300213901966e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 3.3563296710781287e-06, 'Body': 3.531429371150807e-08, 'Clarification': 5.966731464468467e-07, 'Conclusion': 3.158750985221559e-07, 'Election': 1.055741449818015e-06, 'General': 0.9999288320541382, 'Introduction': 9.30987334868405e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 5.784585610513204e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 5.638282800646266e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 1.5511386664002202e-07, 'MeetingSegment': 4.932155934511684e-05, 'MeetingStatus': 3.290274719347508e-07, 'OralStatement': 1.4716849818796618e-06, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.1714478748435795e-07, 'RVRequested': 2.7326688467610438e-08, 'RVTaken': 7.98405963564619e-08, 'Session': 1.7516295258701575e-07, 'Sponsorship': 9.453369642642429e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 4.7109256229305174e-07, 'Vote': 7.748118946437899e-08, 'VotingIntention': 2.514513425921905e-06}\",\n[[\"Nguyen Duy Chien\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Viet Nam\", \"UNPE\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"two draft resolutions\", \"DR\"], [\"A/64/L.18\", \"L\"], [\"A/64/L.29\", \"L\"], [\"1982\", \"DATE\"], [\"18\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Viet Nam\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the past year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Viet Nam\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the years ahead\", \"DATE\"], [\"nineteenth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"June 2009\", \"DATE\"], [\"annual\", \"DATE\"], [\"tenth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"past nine\", \"PARA\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Viet Nam\", \"UNPE\"], [\"two draft resolutions\", \"DR\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Viet Nam\", \"UNPE\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Viet Nam\", \"UNPE\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 262,\n            'f': \"262\",\n        },\n\"A_64_PV.56-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 26,\n            'f': \"26\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999735355377197,\n            'f': \"0.9999735355377197\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Al-Ateeqi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, I am pleased to convey to the President our deep gratitude and appreciation for all the outstanding and effective efforts he is making to conduct this session of the General Assembly. We would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his reports, submitted in accordance with paragraphs 128 and 173 of resolution 63/111, relating to ocean affairs and the law of the sea. The State of Kuwait welcomes the contents of the report of the Secretary-General on oceans and the law of the sea (A/64/66). We would like to emphasize that the collective patrimony of the seas and oceans belongs to humankind as a whole. In addition, friendly relations between all States must include adherence to the principles of justice and equality in the enactment of a global economic system that is based on protecting the marine environment and maintaining the sustainability of the oceans, so as to achieve progress and prosperity for the peoples of the world. The State of Kuwait would also like to welcome the ongoing increase in the number of States parties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which this year has reached 159 States. That proves the importance of the Convention at the global and regional levels. In that regard, my country calls on States that have not yet joined the Convention to do so in order to attain universal participation, achieve the Millennium Development Goals and promote international peace and security. Acts of piracy and armed robbery against ships continue to pose a threat to trade and commercial shipping. It also threatens the lives of sailors who work onboard those ships. My country\\u2019s delegation therefore condemns all acts of piracy, hijacking of commercial ships and terrorism that occur on the oceans and seas, in particular the acts of piracy that take place in the Gulf of Aden and off the Somali coast. According to the International Maritime Bureau, the majority of those incidents occurred off the Somali coast during the first six months of this year. To counter such acts of piracy and armed robbery against ships, the international community must coordinate all its efforts by effectively implementing international law, the law of the sea and all other legal instruments to confront pirates and to prosecute criminals. My country\\u2019s delegation commends the Security Council\\u2019s adoption, under Chapter VII of the Charter, of resolution 1846 (2008) of 2 December 2008. That resolution emphasizes the importance of fostering international efforts to combat piracy off the Somali coast by expanding the scope of mandates of regional States and organizations working with Somali officials in order to achieve that goal. The State of Kuwait joined the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1986. Subsequently, in 2002, it acceded to the Agreement relating to the implementation of Part XI of the Convention. Kuwait is also a party to the Protocol concerning Marine Pollution Resulting from Exploration and Exploitation of the Continental Shelf. It is for that reason that the State of Kuwait would like to emphasize the need for respecting international law and relevant international conventions and for guaranteeing their effective implementation, in particular with regard to marine safety and security. 19 That should be done by ensuring that flag States fulfil their responsibilities in the course of innocent or transient passage, as well as by taking all the measures stipulated under international law to guarantee the rights of each State. In conclusion, the State of Kuwait believes that international efforts must be intensified in order to ensure understanding of the effects of climate change on the marine environment and on marine biodiversity and to find appropriate ways and means for adaptation to those changes. Those efforts must also include building the capacities of developing countries and the transfer of technology to them, so as to preserve the marine environment and achieve sustainable development in the oceans and the seas. The State of Kuwait urges all Member States to expand their good offices with a view to improving people\\u2019s lives while also preserving the marine environment, its resources and their optimal use. That can be done by adhering to the provisions of international conventions and rules that guarantee the rights of peoples to use marine resources in an equitable and just fashion, thereby securing for all the sustainability of the marine environment and promoting international peace and security. \",\n\"{'Action': 2.6661950869311113e-07, 'ActionObject': 1.9759320935008873e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 1.4816848761256551e-06, 'Body': 1.1755649786948652e-08, 'Clarification': 3.8632234122815134e-07, 'Conclusion': 1.3870398163362552e-07, 'Election': 4.60188886108881e-07, 'General': 0.9999735355377197, 'Introduction': 9.646700164012145e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 3.9811197893868666e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 2.599757351617882e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 6.745119662809884e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 1.1035868737963028e-05, 'MeetingStatus': 1.7199347723817482e-07, 'OralStatement': 3.845616163289378e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.427214613158867e-07, 'RVRequested': 1.440140096065079e-08, 'RVTaken': 2.9691788583363632e-08, 'Session': 6.09044192856345e-08, 'Sponsorship': 4.465749015025722e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.416773838831432e-07, 'Vote': 6.709512234692738e-08, 'VotingIntention': 1.4636408423029934e-06}\",\n[[\"Al-Ateeqi\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"paragraphs 128\", \"PARA\"], [\"173\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"resolution 63/111\", \"R\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"A/64/66\", \"Symbol\"], [\"as a whole\", \"DR_MOD\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"159\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the first six months of this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolution 1846\", \"R\"], [\"2008\", \"DATE\"], [\"2 December 2008\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"1986\", \"DATE\"], [\"2002\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the State of Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"19\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the State of Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 263,\n            'f': \"263\",\n        },\n\"A_64_PV.56-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 27,\n            'f': \"27\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999799728393555,\n            'f': \"0.9999799728393555\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Budiman (Indonesia): At the outset, allow me to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General for his comprehensive reports on ocean affairs and the law of the sea contained in documents A/64/66 and Add.1 and Add.2. We also wish to thank the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea and the Secretariat for their valuable support in the consideration of issues related to the law of the sea during this session. Indonesia continues to participate actively in the consideration of issues related to the law of the sea, including fisheries, the maritime environment and navigation. There are two main reasons for our interest. First, we are the largest archipelagic State in the world, occupying a position of strategic importance between the Asian and Australian continents and within most of the important Asian waters. Secondly, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is one of the most important constitutive instruments in international law regulating the uses of one of the world\\u2019s largest set of resources. On the issue of the safety of navigation and maritime security, I wish to take this opportunity to underline our unwavering commitment to suppressing armed robbery and piracy on the high seas adjacent to waters within our national jurisdiction. Indonesia, together with other littoral States, continues to strengthen cooperation in combating armed robbery and piracy in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. We are pleased that those concerted measures have significantly decreased incidents of piracy and armed robbery against ships in the region. As far as the situation off the coast of Somalia is concerned, Indonesia notes the adoption of Security Council resolution 1897 (2009) on 30 November 2009. In this regard, my delegation also recalls Council resolutions 1816 (2008), 1831 (2008), 1838 (2008), 1844 (2008), 1846 (2008) and 1851 (2008), which were adopted to narrowly address piracy and armed robbery committed against ships off the coast of Somalia. Therefore, the authorization granted under those resolutions does not affect rights or obligations or responsibilities under international law, including any rights or obligations under UNCLOS, and they are not considered to establish customary international law. The Government of Indonesia attaches great importance to the work of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. We appreciate that, at its twenty-third session, the Commission began consideration of our submission with respect to north- west Sumatra, Indonesia. However, Indonesia is concerned about the recent work overload that the Commission must be facing in view of the large number of submissions it has already received, as well as forthcoming submissions that could impact on the Commission\\u2019s projected work timetable. We hope that States actively participating in the ongoing work of the informal working group dealing with the issue of the Commission\\u2019s workload will contribute constructively. Furthermore, we encourage States to make additional contributions to the two voluntary trust funds established by resolution 55/7 with laudable objectives. Those trust funds facilitate the preparation of submissions to the Commission by developing States and are also used to defray the cost of the participation by developing States members of the Commission in meetings of the Commission and its subcommissions. 20 Turning to fisheries issues, Indonesia is of the view that the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement is of paramount importance. For that reason, on 28 September 2009, Indonesia ratified the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. Indonesia believes that that Agreement sets out principles for the conservation and management of fish stocks and provides for management based on a precautionary approach and the best available scientific information. The Agreement also develops the fundamental principle established in the Convention that States should cooperate to ensure conservation and promote the objective of optimally utilizing fisheries resources both within and beyond their exclusive economic zones. By ratifying and implementing the Agreement, Indonesia joins the international community in its efforts to sustainably manage fish stocks and their link to the marine environment. We continue to be very concerned about illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing activities that threaten the sustainability of fish stock resources. Indonesia is of the view that such fishing is a global problem that undercuts responsible fishing activities. It undermines conservation and enforcement efforts and distorts trade and prices in export markets. In the light of that, Indonesia welcomes the adoption by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations on 22 November 2009 of the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing. The Agreement recognizes that States have the sovereign right to decide which foreign vessels may enter their ports, in particular as regards vessels that undertake or support IUU fishing activities, building on existing measures taken in some regional fisheries management organizations. Obviously, the effectiveness of the Agreement depends on its wide ratification and implementation. But it is hoped that the agreement will help block IUU-caught fish from entering international markets, thereby removing an important incentive for some fishermen to engage in illicit fishing. Issues related to oceans and climate change continue to be of serious concern for coastal States. Indonesia\\u2019s unique situation has caused us to undertake special initiatives to increase our awareness of the impact of climate change in connection with the ocean and of the ocean\\u2019s possible role in addressing the challenge of climate change. That is why, for the second consecutive year, Indonesia supports the insertion of a paragraph concerning climate change and the oceans in the draft resolution on oceans and the law of the sea. Indonesia is pleased that the draft resolution we are about to adopt makes reference to the need to improve understanding of the impact of climate change on the ocean, following on the World Ocean Conference, which was held in Manado, Indonesia, in May this year, at which the Manado Ocean Declaration was adopted. We believe that the Declaration will contribute to shedding light on the new challenges we face in promoting healthier oceans for the socio- economic benefit of present and future generations. The Declaration also emphasizes the need for the international community to work together for improved understanding of the impact of oceans on climate change and vice versa, and its effects on marine ecosystems, marine biodiversity and coastal communities. The Declaration underscores the importance of incorporating ocean-sensitive policies into climate change policy at the global level within the existing framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, thereby making sure that the concerns of ocean communities and coastal countries will be taken into account without necessarily creating new processes that might duplicate existing ones. Lastly, with regard to consultations, we wish to underline the importance and value of the informal, open and inclusive nature of the consultative process for discussions on ocean affairs within the United Nations system. Before concluding, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the coordinators of the law of the sea and the sustainable fisheries resolutions, Ambassador Henrique Valle of Brazil and Ms. Holly Koehler of the United States of America, for their able leadership and excellent contribution to the work on the two resolutions before us today. \",\n\"{'Action': 6.799126026635349e-07, 'ActionObject': 7.098780656633608e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 1.029652480610821e-06, 'Body': 1.7992718426285137e-08, 'Clarification': 7.336451517403475e-07, 'Conclusion': 1.4848411922230298e-07, 'Election': 7.033602287265239e-07, 'General': 0.9999799728393555, 'Introduction': 2.1097901026223553e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 9.339098738792018e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 2.7297701876705105e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 5.996858476464695e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 8.674964192323387e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 1.9587569966006413e-07, 'OralStatement': 1.8816974716173718e-06, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.1470834238025418e-07, 'RVRequested': 1.1506403829741885e-08, 'RVTaken': 4.965693989333886e-08, 'Session': 1.2024150919387466e-07, 'Sponsorship': 2.8289667852732236e-07, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.504767735445057e-07, 'Vote': 8.441968901706787e-08, 'VotingIntention': 1.7823574580688728e-06}\",\n[[\"Budiman\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"A/64/66\", \"Symbol\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Secondly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Singapore\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Somalia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"resolution 1897\", \"R\"], [\"2009\", \"DATE\"], [\"30 November 2009\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolutions 1816\", \"R\"], [\"2008\", \"DATE\"], [\"1831\", \"DATE\"], [\"2008\", \"DATE\"], [\"1838\", \"DATE\"], [\"2008\", \"DATE\"], [\"1844\", \"DATE\"], [\"2008\", \"DATE\"], [\"1846\", \"DATE\"], [\"2008\", \"DATE\"], [\"1851\", \"DATE\"], [\"2008\", \"DATE\"], [\"Somalia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"resolution 55/7\", \"R\"], [\"20\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"28 September 2009\", \"DATE\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"December 1982\", \"DATE\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"22\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"November 2009\", \"DATE\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the second consecutive year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"May this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolutions,\", \"R\"], [\"Henrique Valle\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Brazil\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Holly Koehler\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the United States of America\", \"UNPE\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 264,\n            'f': \"264\",\n        },\n\"A_64_PV.56-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 28,\n            'f': \"28\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999872446060181,\n            'f': \"0.9999872446060181\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Tladi (South Africa): I am grateful for the opportunity to take the floor on this very important 21 topic, that of oceans and the law of the sea. I am also happy to associate myself with the statement delivered by the Permanent Representative of Benin, who spoke on behalf of the Group of African States. This debate gives us an opportunity to reflect on our activities over the sixty-third session and look forward to forthcoming activities at the sixty-fourth session. We should, as we reflect and look forward, be continually guided by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which constitutes the framework within which all activities in the oceans take place. In reflecting on those activities, we should be ever mindful of the opportunities, challenges and prospects in our efforts to create an oceans governance system underpinned by sustainable development. My delegation is unwavering in its belief in the universal character of UNCLOS and that large parts of it constitute customary international law binding on all States, whether State party or not. We are particularly pleased to welcome Chad, the Dominican Republic and Switzerland, which have, since our last debate on the agenda item, become States parties to the Convention, thereby bringing the total number of States parties to 160. We hope that in the near future all Member States of the United Nations will accede to the Convention so that this instrument, the \\u201cConstitution of the oceans\\u201d, can achieve quantitative universality. We hope also that those States parties that are not as yet party to the two implementing agreements of the Convention, namely the Agreement relating to the Implementation of Part XI of the Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 and the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, will accede to those agreements sooner rather than later. We welcome the outcome of the negotiations on the draft omnibus resolution on oceans and the law of the sea and are proud, once again, to co-sponsor the resolution. We also welcome the fruitful deliberations on the draft fisheries resolution. It was on 8 December 2006 that the General Assembly adopted resolution 61/105, which contained provisions on bottom fishing. In that resolution we called on the regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) and arrangements with competence to regulate bottom 22 fisheries to adopt and implement certain measures to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems. In the resolution we also called for a review of those measures at the current session. In his report on actions taken by States and RFMOs in the implementation of resolution 61/105, contained in A/64/305, the Secretary-General noted that, while progress has been made, implementation of the resolution had been uneven and that further efforts were needed. We are of the view that more could be done to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems from the damage that can occur as a result of bottom fishing than the protective regulations laid out in resolution 61/105. We remain optimistic, however, that the approach we have taken this year, the result of consensus, will contribute to the cultivation of more sustainable fishing practices. We are particularly hopefully that in 2011, when we meet to yet again review the measures we have adopted, sterner regulations will have been adopted and wider implementation recorded. It will come as no surprise to many here that my delegation attaches particular importance to Part XI of the Convention. We therefore continue to push for the early implementation and operationalization of the common heritage of humanity principle, as reflected in Part XI. For that reason, my delegation is an active participant in the deliberations of the International Seabed Authority (ISA). We are concerned at the apparent inability of the Council of the International Seabed Authority to finalize regulations on polymetallic sulphides. We are encouraged by the fact that only a few contentious issues, including the question of overlapping claims and the anti-monopoly provision, remain. Nonetheless, we urge delegations to do their utmost to ensure that a consensus is reached on those outstanding issues. We believe that the Convention, in particular \",\n\"{'Action': 9.144065984401095e-07, 'ActionObject': 3.660894378754165e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 7.670998343201063e-07, 'Body': 7.971847182375313e-09, 'Clarification': 1.4409234836421092e-06, 'Conclusion': 1.5094207128640846e-07, 'Election': 1.61235107043467e-07, 'General': 0.9999872446060181, 'Introduction': 2.163113776987302e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 8.300060017063515e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 2.83449367088906e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 2.1748688183720333e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 4.6328733560585533e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 4.0785812416288536e-07, 'OralStatement': 1.5401450355057023e-06, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.3637115848250687e-07, 'RVRequested': 4.6268020525985776e-09, 'RVTaken': 3.461590480924315e-08, 'Session': 5.199952823886633e-08, 'Sponsorship': 9.333610506701007e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.0721624593988963e-07, 'Vote': 7.004472024618735e-08, 'VotingIntention': 3.091350890827016e-06}\",\n[[\"Tladi\", \"PERSON\"], [\"South Africa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"21\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Benin\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Chad\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the Dominican Republic\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Switzerland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"160\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"\\u201cConstitution of the oceans\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"December 1982\", \"DATE\"], [\"December 1982\", \"DATE\"], [\"8 December 2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolution 61/105\", \"R\"], [\"22\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"resolution 61/105\", \"R\"], [\"A/64/305\", \"Symbol\"], [\"resolution 61/105\", \"R\"], [\"this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"2011\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 265,\n            'f': \"265\",\n        },\n\"A_64_PV.56-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 29,\n            'f': \"29\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999990463256836,\n            'f': \"0.9999990463256836\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Annex III, entitled \\u201cBasic Conditions of Prospecting, Exploration and Exploitation\\u201d, provides a sound basis for enabling the finalization of outstanding issues at the next meeting of the Authority in April 2010. For us, the common heritage of humanity principle is not only an esoteric concept, but a principle of international law. We are thus concerned at the lack of its implementation and operationalization owing to, inter alia, the non-completion of the regulations. Another factor having a negative impact on the full implementation of Part XI of the Convention is the difficulty encountered in the establishment of the outer limits of the continental shelf, as provided for in article 76 of the Convention. South Africa sent its continental shelf submission to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) in May of this year, in accordance with the Convention and yet, owing to the workload of the Commission, the prognosis is that a subcommission to consider the South African submission will only be formed in 2019. That is a most unsatisfactory situation. We have no doubt that the only solution to that difficulty will be to have longer and/or more frequent sessions of the Commission. Indeed, there may be legal, technical and financial constraints. But the significance of the endeavours to establish the limits of the continental shelf leads me, unavoidably, to a clich\\u00e9, namely, that \\u201cwhere there is a will, there is a way\\u201d. We therefore call on States to consider innovative ways to facilitate the funding of such longer and/or more frequent sessions of the CLCS. The Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea (UNICPOLOS) held its review in June of this year. We are pleased that, after much discussion, the vast majority of delegations that took part in UNICPOLOS discussions were supportive and saw it as an important forum to deliberate, in an informal manner, issues pertaining to oceans and the law of the sea, with a view to strengthening coordination and contributing to the deliberations of the General Assembly under the agenda item. We were also particularly pleased that attendees at the meeting recognized the centrality of sustainable development as the prism through which those issues ought to be discussed. My delegation wishes to reiterate its commitment to UNICPOLOS and looks forward to working with other delegations to strengthen that important forum for the law of the sea. We are pleased that in the next session we will have an opportunity to discuss an issue that has not been given sufficient follow-up, namely, capacity-building in oceans affairs and the law of the sea, including marine scientific research. I now wish to make some brief observations on a forthcoming issue that is of particular importance to my delegation. In February 2010, the Ad Hoc Open- ended Working Group to study issues relating to the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction will meet. That will provide us with an opportunity to make progress on key issues relating to marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction. Some of the key questions that will be confronting us will be how to improve the governance of the oceans, so as to ensure better protection of the marine environment in accordance with the Convention. Another issue that is sure to confront us will be the question of marine genetic resources and, in particular, whether the common heritage of humanity principle is applicable thereto \\u2014 that is, the \\u201clegal regime\\u201d debate. The view of my delegation, which is rooted in the call for solidarity embodied in sustainable development, is well known and can be summed up by what we said in 2008 during the last meeting of the Ad Hoc Working Group, namely, that the common heritage of mankind principle is not solely about benefit sharing. It is just as much about conservation and preservation. The principle is about solidarity; solidarity in the preservation and conservation of a good we all share and therefore should protect. Solidarity also implies joint efforts to ensure that this good, which we all share, is for all our benefit. It is our hope that the meeting of the Ad Hoc Working Group in February will come up concrete proposals on how to move issues relating to conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction forward. From the perspective of my delegation, it is clear that moving forward must, somehow, involve discussion about an implementing agreement to give expression to the clear provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, namely, that the Area and its resources \\u2014 not just some of its resources, but all of them \\u2014 are the common heritage of humanity. We trust that, as we make preparations for how we will participate at this forthcoming meeting, we will remember that what is at stake is not only the narrow commercial interests of some. What is at stake is the health of our marine environment and the humanity, which can only be reflected in our solidarity in ensuring equitable access for all. \",\n\"{'Action': 2.1819619888674424e-08, 'ActionObject': 6.532123730806916e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 1.0609485201484858e-07, 'Body': 3.312281560141628e-10, 'Clarification': 7.895118869782891e-08, 'Conclusion': 1.1898063867477049e-08, 'Election': 1.5595922775446525e-08, 'General': 0.9999990463256836, 'Introduction': 7.116013733821092e-08, 'MeetingDateTime': 4.8983754830089765e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 3.2256721738121996e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 2.7329634111339374e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 8.379645066725061e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 2.6934285912716405e-08, 'OralStatement': 2.276770629805469e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.0405881489816693e-08, 'RVRequested': 1.6523096779685886e-10, 'RVTaken': 1.741174537883694e-09, 'Session': 5.9194196211365124e-09, 'Sponsorship': 5.066964181565936e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 4.0023473424355416e-09, 'Vote': 5.720667051178907e-09, 'VotingIntention': 2.2163622759308055e-07}\",\n[[\"entitled \\u201cBasic Conditions of Prospecting, Exploration and Exploitation\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"April 2010\", \"PARA\"], [\"article 76 of the Convention\", \"DATE\"], [\"South Africa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"CLCS\", \"PERSON\"], [\"May of this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"2019\", \"DATE\"], [\"\\u201cwhere there is a will, there is a way\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"June of this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"February 2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"\\u201clegal regime\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"2008\", \"DATE\"], [\"February\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 266,\n            'f': \"266\",\n        },\n\"A_64_PV.56-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 30,\n            'f': \"30\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999839067459106,\n            'f': \"0.9999839067459106\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Muchemi (Kenya): Allow me to start by congratulating you, Mr. President, on your election as 23 President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I also convey to the other members of the Bureau warm congratulations for their elections. My delegation assures you of its support and full cooperation during your tenure. My delegation fully aligns itself with the statement delivered by the representative of Benin on behalf of the African States. Kenya expresses its appreciation and recognition for the key role the United Nations continues to play in matters relating to the law of the sea. I would like to commend the good work of the Secretariat of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea under the able leadership of Mr. Serguei Tarassenko, and to thank them for their support, in particular during the recent informal consultations. My delegation notes with appreciation the various reports of the Secretary-General on the subject of oceans and the law of the sea. We also appreciate the text of the draft resolution on oceans and the law of the sea, resulting from this year\\u2019s informal consultations in the General Assembly, and the draft on sustainable fisheries, both of which we are pleased to sponsor. I now wish to comment on some of the issues that are of great concern to my delegation. Kenya is among the many coastal States that delivered their submissions on the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) within the stipulated deadline of 13 May 2009. This was followed by an oral presentation made before the Commission at its twenty-fourth session on 3 September 2009. At an early stage in the preparation of its submission, Kenya noted with concern the anticipated heavy workload of the Commission that will be occasioned by the considerable number of States filing their submissions to the Commission in compliance with the deadline set for delineation of the extended continental shelf. Some 51 submissions have already been received and many others are expected. The Commission will subsequently be faced with the huge workload of examining all the submissions within an acceptable time frame. This places a huge and unprecedented burden on both the Commission and the secretariat of the Division. During the nineteenth Meeting of States Parties to the Convention, the Chairman of the Commission presented to the plenary a tentative timetable detailing when the 51 submissions already received might be considered. The situation as projected would result in a considerable time lapse between the preparation of submissions and their consideration by the Commission, a scenario that is obviously unacceptable to my country, considering that it will greatly jeopardize our submission. The problem is compounded further by difficulties associated with the retention of the expertise that was directly responsible for the preparation of the submission, including the loss of institutional memory. Kenya welcomes the recommendations contained in paragraphs 52 and 53 of the omnibus draft resolution encouraging States to participate actively and constructively in the ongoing work of the informal Working Group established by States parties to find practical ways of resolving this matter. My country is ready to support proposals aimed at accelerating the work of the Commission, and will forward its views to the Working Group before the February 2010 deadline for the submission of comments and suggestions. We are convinced that the outcome of the Meeting of States Parties in June 2010 should be informed by the recommendations submitted to the Working Group for incorporation into the Secretary-General\\u2019s report on the problem, which is contained in document SPLOS/157. The issue of piracy and armed robbery against ships at sea off the coast of Somalia is of grave concern to my country. These activities have greatly affected trade and commerce in the entire subregion. In addition, acts of piracy have led to artificial shortages of food and other essential commodities. This poses a serious security risk that, if left unchecked, could cause a serious crisis and much instability in the entire region. Although efforts by the international community, including the establishment of a Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia, have had some deterrent effect on piracy and armed robbery in our region, more needs to be done. In particular, it appears that apprehended pirates are being prosecuted mainly in Kenyan courts. This burden weighs heavily on Kenya, in terms of financial cost and security exposure, and we call upon all other nations to participate in this endeavour. Capacity-building is an area that is regarded with great interest by my country. The lack of capacity and 24 technical know-how has immensely contributed to the inability of developing countries to exploit and utilize marine resources, especially those found within their national jurisdictions. Needless to say, this has also aggravated illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. We appreciate the assistance extended to Kenya by the Division and by the Trust Fund for the purpose of facilitating the preparation of submissions by developing countries to the Commission. It is of vital importance to strengthen cooperation to facilitate the transfer of technology to developing nations. In this regard, we urge States and other relevant international organizations and institutions with the ability to do so to increase funding, training opportunities and other capacity-building-related activities for developing nations. In conclusion, my delegation reaffirms its commitment to the ideals enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and reassures the President of the General Assembly of its support. We look forward to the fruitful deliberations of this body under his able guidance. \",\n\"{'Action': 7.527613092861429e-07, 'ActionObject': 2.7214889541937737e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 1.985835524465074e-06, 'Body': 1.3255820441315791e-08, 'Clarification': 7.411006777147122e-07, 'Conclusion': 1.0098474945152702e-07, 'Election': 5.413472763393656e-07, 'General': 0.9999839067459106, 'Introduction': 3.192424856024445e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 5.699803296010941e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 3.166486521877232e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 5.7723610780158197e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 4.420567165652756e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 3.494673990189767e-07, 'OralStatement': 1.1704760254360735e-06, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.4003546172934875e-07, 'RVRequested': 8.574549070772264e-09, 'RVTaken': 3.352122490696274e-08, 'Session': 7.842500338028913e-08, 'Sponsorship': 4.343499071524093e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.763750615031313e-07, 'Vote': 5.197199470785563e-08, 'VotingIntention': 1.5004291071818443e-06}\",\n[[\"Muchemi\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"23\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Bureau\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Benin\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Serguei Tarassenko\", \"PERSON\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"], [\"13\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"May 2009\", \"DATE\"], [\"3 September 2009\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Some 51\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"nineteenth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"51\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"], [\"paragraphs 52\", \"PARA\"], [\"53\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"February 2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"June 2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"Somalia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Somalia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"], [\"24\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 267,\n            'f': \"267\",\n        },\n\"A_64_PV.56-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 31,\n            'f': \"31\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999585151672363,\n            'f': \"0.9999585151672363\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Guti\\u00e9rrez Garc\\u00eda (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): We reaffirm the fundamental importance of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in maintaining and strengthening peace, order and the sustainable development of the oceans and seas. Cuba places particular emphasis on the need to strengthen international cooperation among all stakeholders participating in the management of seas and oceans, including knowledge exchange and capacity-building, which are of vital significance for developing countries. For my country, as an island located in the delicate ecosystem of the Caribbean Sea, issues relating to the seas and the oceans are of particular interest. Despite the serious economic hardships that it faces, Cuba has carried out and continues to carry out great efforts to implement national strategies for sustainable development and for the protection of the marine environment, with a view to achieving a coherent, progressive and effective implementation of the Convention\\u2019s provisions. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea establishes the proper and universally accepted legal framework within which all of the activities on the oceans and seas must be carried out. We are, therefore, concerned by policies and initiatives that are undermining the regime of the Convention, such as the management being assigned to new sustainable uses of oceans, including the conservation and management of marine biological biodiversity of sea beds beyond areas of national jurisdiction. In this respect, States must abide by the principles established in the Convention, which provides that marine scientific research in such areas must be carried out exclusively for peaceful purposes and for the benefit of humanity as a whole. We warmly welcome the work of the Ad Hoc Working Group of the Whole tasked with recommending a course of action to the General Assembly on the regular process for global reporting and assessment of the state of the marine environment, including socioeconomic aspects. We welcome in particular the recommendations annexed to its report. This process must be carried out on the basis of respect for the principles enshrined in the aforementioned recommendations, which guarantee the full transparency of the process and an equitable geographic participation in all activities of the process. Cuba believes that, under the supervision of the General Assembly and in order to ensure greater coherence, that process must have the ongoing assistance of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea. Matters concerning crime at sea must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. They require holistic solutions under international law and strict respect for national jurisdictions. The Cuban State is endowed with a solid institutional basis and national legislation when it comes to addressing crime at sea, in particular with regard to the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, trafficking in persons and piracy. Likewise, intense work is being done to continue to strengthen bilateral and regional cooperation, with due respect for the principles of international law and State sovereignty over territorial waters and the management of resources in their exclusive economic zones. We would also like to underscore the importance of preserving the Convention\\u2019s integrity and the implementation of its provisions as a whole, including respect for the right of passage and the obligation of States bordering straits to adopt laws and regulations relating to transit passage through straits. Oceans and seas today face one of the greatest challenges in history, namely, problems arising from 25 climate change on an unprecedented scale. Arctic ice thickness continues to decrease. Glaciers are receding. The sea level is rising. Small island States run the risk of disappearing under water. The interconnected nature of ocean systems leaves no other option but for all States to cooperate to ensure the protection of the global marine environment. Either we are all saved or no one is. Developed countries therefore have a responsibility to provide assistance to developing countries at their request, so as to work together to protect oceans and seas. With regard to the 1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, Cuba is not a party to the Agreement, but we comply in good faith with its major provisions on conservation and management. The main reason that has prevented Cuba from becoming party to the Agreement has to do with its concern about the mechanism of visits and inspection aboard fishing vessels, which is provided for in articles 21 and 22 of that instrument. I do not want to conclude without expressing our appreciation for the work done by the coordinators of the two draft resolutions to be adopted on this topic, which Cuba will support. Likewise, owing to the growing importance of the issue of oceans and the law of the sea, there is a need to provide full conference and translation services for informal meetings to negotiate such draft resolutions. That would contribute to the quality of the negotiations, so that they clearly reflect the interests of all States, in particular of developing countries. \",\n\"{'Action': 6.400489951374766e-07, 'ActionObject': 6.46473097276612e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 4.790128514287062e-06, 'Body': 3.304464968323373e-08, 'Clarification': 1.7372072989019216e-06, 'Conclusion': 4.603606100772595e-07, 'Election': 3.90484700574234e-07, 'General': 0.9999585151672363, 'Introduction': 5.301642886479385e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.0096293578953919e-07, 'MeetingLocation': 6.880751470816904e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 1.2904159518711822e-07, 'MeetingSegment': 1.3902795217290986e-05, 'MeetingStatus': 4.448126276201947e-07, 'OralStatement': 5.771048108726973e-06, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.1303821401706955e-07, 'RVRequested': 2.2483916950477578e-08, 'RVTaken': 9.890594299122313e-08, 'Session': 1.2606149368821207e-07, 'Sponsorship': 1.9235284298702027e-07, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 4.315730564030673e-07, 'Vote': 5.7064902136971796e-08, 'VotingIntention': 5.183307166589657e-06}\",\n[[\"Guti\\u00e9rrez Garc\\u00eda\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Cuba\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Cuba\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Cuba\", \"UNPE\"], [\"as a whole\", \"DR_MOD\"], [\"Cuba\", \"UNPE\"], [\"as a whole\", \"DR_MOD\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"25\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"1995\", \"DATE\"], [\"10 December 1982\", \"DATE\"], [\"Cuba\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Cuba\", \"UNPE\"], [\"21\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"22\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"draft resolutions to\", \"DR\"], [\"Cuba\", \"UNPE\"], [\"draft resolutions\", \"DR\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 268,\n            'f': \"268\",\n        },\n\"A_64_PV.56-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 32,\n            'f': \"32\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999935626983643,\n            'f': \"0.9999935626983643\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Kohona (Sri Lanka): We would like to take this opportunity to thank the two coordinators who have guided us in the shaping the draft resolutions before us. We also wish to thank the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for the support it has provided in that task. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is the overarching instrument that provides the legal framework for State activities relating to the seas and the oceans and for the regulation of the exploitation of their resources. It has been said that the Convention provides the constitution for the seas and 26 oceans. All States parties, and others, have a fundamental responsibility to protect the integrity of the Convention. Many provisions of the Convention are now considered to be part of customary international law. In this statement, my delegation wishes to address the issues of fisheries, climate change, the continental shelf and piracy. In relation to sub-item (b) of agenda item 76, on sustainable fisheries, the Convention on the Law of the Sea provides for the protection and preservation of the marine environment. The issue of fisheries management has assumed much importance. Today, the regulation of the exploitation and preservation of the living resources of the high seas, or the areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, are governed by the 1995 Straddling Fish Stocks Agreement and other international, regional and subregional arrangements. Fishing activities have the most significant impact on marine biodiversity in areas within and beyond national jurisdiction. We are conscious of the overfishing of stocks, habitat degradation from destructive fishing practices and the incidental capture of non-target species, including endangered species. My delegation welcomes the steps taken by the United Nations and various agencies \\u2014 such as the Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Whaling Commission and the Forum Fisheries Agency \\u2014 with regard to those aspects. We encourage them to develop further strategies to that end. Fish do not recognize national jurisdictions. As a nation that is surrounded by the sea and is substantially dependent upon the ocean, we would like to see fisheries beyond the limits of national jurisdiction better controlled through cooperative means. The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission is active in its namesake region. However, there is a need for a regional fisheries management organization or arrangement with wider powers and the capacity to effectively regulate all high-seas fisheries and the conservation of stocks in that vast expanse of ocean. While we endorse the adoption of international agreements, guidelines and practices for the better regulation of bottom fisheries, we are conscious of the need to accommodate the difficulties that developing countries may face, especially owing to the lack of capacity, in enforcing such measures. Accordingly, we are pleased that the negotiations led to the adoption of paragraph 121 in draft resolution A/64/L.29, which recognizes the special circumstances and requirements of developing States and the specific challenges they may face and gives full consideration to the section of the guidelines on the special requirements of developing countries. Sri Lanka would also like to refer to the study prepared by the Secretariat, which is contained in document A/63/342, with regard to the assistance available to, and measures that may be taken by, developing States to realize the benefits of the sustainable and effective development of marine resources and the uses of oceans. The scope of the study has now been extended to include areas beyond national jurisdiction, which include the high seas. Oceans are indivisible ecosystems in which national boundaries are products of political expediency. Therefore, while jurisdiction over resources gives the needs of developing States with respect to the sustainable development of maritime space within national jurisdiction an urgent and distinctive dimension, their needs in maritime space beyond national jurisdiction are to be viewed in an integrated manner. Sri Lanka therefore welcomes the supplemental inclusive study to include the needs of the developing States and the potential assistance available to them with respect to the whole ecosystem of oceans, as envisaged in the draft resolution. Turning to sub-item (a) of agenda item 76 and the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf: my delegation considers that body to be most important, and we believe that measures should be taken immediately to secure the effectiveness of the important work of the Commission. A matter of great concern is the Commission\\u2019s workload. States were required to submit their claims to the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles by 13 May 2009. Many States, at great expense and with the use of outside technical expertise, made these submissions within the stipulated deadline. Sri Lanka was one of them. However, the workload of the Commission and the slow progress it has made in dealing with the submissions have evoked great concern. It is estimated that some claims already lodged may be examined as late as 2040. We are, in fact, pleased to have participated in the efforts to find practical solutions to this problem. We look forward to positive results and appropriate measures being adopted by the twentieth Meeting of the States Parties to the Law of the Sea Convention in 2010 and by the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Climate change continues to figure prominently on the international agenda, as human-induced changes to the climate continue to threaten the global environmental balance. The world\\u2019s oceans play a critical role in sustaining life on earth by generating oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, regulating climate and temperature and providing essential resources. Changes to the climate have a direct impact on the oceans and lead to a number of critical threats, such as sea-level rise and ocean acidification. Such effects also impair the ability of marine and coastal ecosystems to provide food, income, cultural identity and recreation to coastal residents. Sea coasts are also a major source of tourism income for many States. Many key climate indicators have already helped improve our understanding of the patterns of natural variability within which our societies and economies have developed and thrived. Ocean warming appears to be approximately 50 per cent greater than what we had predicted. New estimates suggest that by 2100 sea levels could rise by one metre or more. The impacts of ocean acidification on some major marine calcifiers already appear to be detectable and some coastal waters have become corrosive to the shells of various bottom-dwelling organisms. The oceans may be losing the ability to absorb carbon dioxide. With unabated levels of greenhouse-gas emissions, many climate trends are likely to accelerate, leading to an increasing risk of abrupt or irreversible climate shifts. The adverse effects of climate change on the marine environment and marine biodiversity are matters of serious concern and have to be addressed with a sense of urgency. Research activities need to be enhanced to help us to better understand the effects of climate change on the marine environment and biodiversity, and to develop ways and means of adaptation. Research on ocean acidification has to be pursued to address levels of ocean acidity and their negative impact on vulnerable marine ecosystems, particularly coral reefs. It is necessary, therefore, to recognize the importance of improved understanding of the impact of climate change on the oceans and to 27 formulate and adopt mitigating strategies to overcome them. Regarding piracy, my delegation expresses its grave concern at the increase in the incidence of piracy, which poses a threat to maritime security and safety. This has become a threat to global trade and a factor, for instance, in insurance costs. We welcome the concerted efforts made by some States to combat piracy. All types of vessels have been targeted, often by well-armed criminals with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons. More than 238 attacks occurred in the first six months of 2009 alone. Sri Lanka is a party to the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP), which, with its information-sharing, has had positive effects in the region. In addition to piracy, another threat to maritime security is that posed by the transportation of large consignments of sophisticated equipment and lethal cargo to provide logistical support to terrorist groups. In recent years, Sri Lanka has experienced unprecedented and highly dangerous forms of maritime terrorism. Our navy has successfully confronted and interdicted the movement of virtual floating warehouses of arms and ammunition, posing a grave threat to the security and stability of our country and our region. At the global level, this phenomenon calls for a revision of existing laws pertaining to boarding and search of vessels in the high seas. We need a comprehensive legal framework to address all aspects of safety and security of maritime navigation, going beyond the current concerns with weapons of mass destruction. This would make a distinct contribution to securing global peace and security. Sri Lanka strongly supports paragraphs 68 to 83 of the draft resolution (A/64/L.18 and Corr.1) addressing the issues of piracy and armed robbery at sea. Finally, I would like to express our gratitude to Ms. Patricia O\\u2019Brien, the United Nations Legal Counsel, for her undertaking to comply with the assurance given by her predecessor that the Hamilton Shirley Amarasinghe Fellowship on the Law of the Sea would continue with the next award in 2010. The Fellowship has acquired much prestige, as it honours a prominent Sri Lankan who guided the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea from its very inception and as Chair of the Ad Hoc Committee 28 on the Seabed and Ocean Floor till nearly the end of the Conference. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.4617653221193905e-07, 'ActionObject': 8.581474020274982e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 6.46710361706937e-07, 'Body': 4.362377570288345e-09, 'Clarification': 3.784869022638304e-07, 'Conclusion': 7.422966064041248e-08, 'Election': 1.20913767887032e-07, 'General': 0.9999935626983643, 'Introduction': 8.306395784529741e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.4997959258143965e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 1.4554555605172936e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 2.305992374829202e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 1.6710841919120867e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 1.0826316554357618e-07, 'OralStatement': 9.74389081420668e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 6.265563712304356e-08, 'RVRequested': 2.5827504579467586e-09, 'RVTaken': 1.5258871499668203e-08, 'Session': 3.557605765536209e-08, 'Sponsorship': 4.3656008585912787e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 5.548949388867186e-08, 'Vote': 2.3009794958284147e-08, 'VotingIntention': 1.0862778481168789e-06}\",\n[[\"Kohona\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Sri Lanka\", \"UNPE\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"draft resolutions\", \"DR\"], [\"26\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"sub-item (b) of agenda item 76\", \"ASI\"], [\"Today\", \"DATE\"], [\"1995\", \"DATE\"], [\"paragraph 121\", \"PARA\"], [\"draft resolution A/64/L.29\", \"DR\"], [\"Sri Lanka\", \"UNPE\"], [\"A/63/342\", \"Symbol\"], [\"Sri Lanka\", \"UNPE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"sub-item (a) of agenda item 76\", \"ASI\"], [\"13\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"May 2009\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sri Lanka\", \"UNPE\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"as late as 2040\", \"DATE\"], [\"twentieth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"sixty-fifth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"approximately 50\", \"PARA\"], [\"27\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"More than 238\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the first six months of 2009\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sri Lanka\", \"UNPE\"], [\"recent years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sri Lanka\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sri Lanka\", \"UNPE\"], [\"paragraphs 68 to 83\", \"PARA\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"A/64/L.18\", \"L\"], [\"Patricia O\\u2019Brien\", \"PERSON\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sri Lankan\", \"PERSON\"], [\"third\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"28\", \"CARDINAL\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 269,\n            'f': \"269\",\n        },\n\"A_64_PV.56-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 33,\n            'f': \"33\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999823570251465,\n            'f': \"0.9999823570251465\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Gan (Singapore): I have the honour to speak on sub-item (a) of agenda item 76, \\u201cOceans and the law of the sea\\u201d. The Straits of Malacca and Singapore are one of the busiest international waterways in the world, linking the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea. On average, more than 900 ships use the Strait of Singapore every day, with more than 80 per cent of these ships arriving and departing from the port of Singapore. Maritime trade and freedom of navigation are therefore of critical importance to our country. We also see the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as the principal international legal instrument for dealing with all issues relating to maritime rights and obligations. A crucial characteristic of the Convention is that it is an indivisible package and as such, it must be read as a whole and fully complied with. When the Convention was drafted, the negotiators recognized that there were a number of very contentious issues that could be resolved only through trade-offs and by accepting the Convention as a package. That meant that every individual provision of the text was agreed on within the context of the whole. This is especially true of the new legal concepts and regimes created under the Convention, such as exclusive economic zones, archipelagic States, transit passage and archipelagic sea lanes passage. We must, therefore, avoid emphasizing parts of the Convention that we like while ignoring parts that we do not. We should not extract paragraphs from the Convention out of context, or misuse certain provisions in an attempt to justify measures that are inconsistent with the Convention. All States Parties have a shared interest in maintaining the integrity of the Convention. A key bargain in the Convention was balancing the aspirations of coastal States to expand the extent of their territorial sea from 3 to 12 nautical miles with the right of the international community to enjoy free and uninterrupted passage through some of the world\\u2019s critical sea lanes. Coastal States were therefore allowed to expand the extent of their territorial sea out to 12 nautical miles, in exchange for accepting a special regime of passage for ships and aircraft going through and over the 116 straits used for international navigation. This special regime, under which a ship or aircraft enjoys unimpeded passage through the strait, subject to the provisions of the Convention, is known as \\u201ctransit passage\\u201d. The coastal State may not interfere with that passage, even if the sea lane is within its territorial sea. This critical provision ensures the continued use of the seas and oceans to facilitate global trade, 85 to 90 per cent of which is seaborne. It was not easy for the drafters of the Convention to arrive at that crucial and delicate balance between the claims of coastal States for more rights over their adjacent seas and the historic rights of user States over those seas. It would thus be wise to maintain that balance, as it benefits both coastal States and user States. With the economies of the world becoming more open and interconnected and as trade flows increase, States that used to think in terms of protecting their interests as coastal States will find that they have significant and growing interests as user States as well. It is, therefore, our firm belief that, within the framework of the Convention, coastal States and user States can work hand in hand to ensure their common interests such as safety of navigation and environmental protection. Singapore is pleased to note the fruitful cooperation among the littoral States of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore as well as between the littoral States, user States and other key stakeholders in ensuring the safety of navigation and environmental protection of critical international waterways in our region. The establishment of the Cooperative Mechanism on the safety of navigation and environmental protection in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore in September 2007 was a landmark achievement, as it provides a platform for the littoral States to engage user States, the shipping industry and other stakeholders in enhancing the safety of navigation and protection of the marine environment in the Straits. We are pleased to report that the Cooperative Mechanism has made good progress in all its three pillars, namely the Cooperation Forum, the six Straits projects under the Project Coordination Committee and the Aids to Navigation Fund, since its inception two years ago. We are encouraged by the steady progress in the number of countries and other stakeholders contributing to the Cooperative Mechanism, including Australia, China, the European Commission, Germany, Greece, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, the Malacca Strait Council, the Middle East Navigation Aids Service, the Nippon Foundation and the Japanese Shipowners\\u2019 Association. More recently, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore concluded a Joint Technical Arrangement with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to institutionalize an IMO Fund that supports cooperation amongst stakeholders aimed at enhancing safety and maritime cooperation in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. The Fund benefited from an initial contribution of $1 million from Greece, as well as a further pledge of $100,000 from China, and marks another major step forward in promoting and facilitating international cooperation in this important international waterway. We look forward to the continued participation and support of all stakeholders. In the larger Asian region, Singapore is pleased to note the continued close cooperation between littoral, coastal and user States aimed at combating piracy. The Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP), which came into force in 2006, is the first Government-to-Government agreement that addresses the incidence of piracy and armed robbery in the Asian region. Contracting States to the Agreement share information on incidents of piracy and armed robbery, including reports on subsequent law enforcement investigations and their outcomes, through the ReCAAP Information Sharing Centre (ReCAAP ISC), based in Singapore. The Information Sharing Centre makes publicly available regular updates and analyses on the piracy and armed robbery situation in the Asian region. The ReCAAP ISC is now regarded as the crucial source of information on piracy and armed robbery in Asia for both the media and the industry. Singapore is also heartened by the ongoing cooperation between ReCAAP ISC and IMO, where IMO has held up ReCAAP as a model of intergovernmental cooperation against piracy for other regions. Most recently, in November 2009, ReCAAP ISC, in conjunction with IMO, organized a familiarization programme for the Djibouti Code countries in Singapore and facilitated the participation of the same countries in a ReCAAP capacity-building workshop in the Philippines. We are confident that the Agreement will continue to play an important role in promoting maritime safety and security in our region. The continued decline in piracy in the Asian region is testament to the success of the organization, together with other regional and national initiatives in the 29 region to fight piracy and armed robbery, such as the Malacca Strait Patrols. As a major maritime nation, Singapore is also strongly committed to supporting the international counter-piracy efforts in the Gulf of Aden and off the coast of Somalia. In addition to deploying a tank- landing ship to the Gulf of Aden from April to July 2009, Singapore will also be taking command of Combined Task Force 151 from January to March 2010. The piracy situation off the Somali coast is a complex and multifaceted problem that is beyond the scope of any one country to resolve. It requires a coordinated and holistic international response. Therefore, the development of international cooperation in those waters, with ships from various nations learning to self-organize into naval patrols and to communicate with one another, is a welcome development. Such efforts, carried out in accordance with international law, demonstrate the important roles that user States can play to complement the efforts of the littoral States in combating piracy and ensuring the safety and freedom of navigation in key sea lanes used for international shipping. Singapore fully supports the ongoing efforts by both the United Nations and IMO to address the urgent situation in those waters. We would also be happy to share our experience in working with Malaysia and Indonesia, through initiatives such as the Malacca Strait Patrols, and our experience as the host of ReCAAP ISC, which has contributed to successfully reducing piracy in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. \",\n\"{'Action': 7.654496698705771e-07, 'ActionObject': 4.099674413282628e-07, 'AgendaStatus':

Mr. Joaqu\\u00edn Alexander Maza Martelli, who will today present the report of the Human Rights Council (A/72/53 and A/72/53/Add.1) to the General Assembly. I congratulate him on his leadership of the Council. \\u201cThe Human Rights Council is the main body within the United Nations dedicated to the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. Its importance remains clear. In so many places around the world we continue to witness violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Council, through its various mechanisms, procedures and resolutions, gives a voice to all people, including those who are most vulnerable and may otherwise not be heard. It is the main forum to address the situation of those facing gross violations, discrimination and exclusion. \\u201cThe Council has commenced the third cycle of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR). The UPR is an inclusive peer-review mechanism, based on the principles of dialogue, cooperation and equal treatment of all Member States. This mechanism reinforces the respect for human rights at both the national and global levels. The success of the UPR is another demonstration that the Human Rights Council is an effective mechanism to advance all human rights. \\u201cPromoting and protecting human rights is one of the three pillars of the United Nations. Each pillar is essential, and all three pillars are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. As I said at the opening of the general debate, \\u2018Human rights are crucial; neither peace nor development can take hold without them\\u2019 (A/72/PV.3, p. 6). The work of the Council is therefore crucial to our collective responsibility to fulfil our commitments to achieving sustainable development, including in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and pursuing global peace and security for \\u2018We the peoples\\u2019. \\u201cThe debates and discussions within the Council are often intense and sometimes contentious. This is an expected scenario given the various interests and sensitivities regarding the issues on the Council\\u2019s agenda. Nevertheless, it is of utmost importance that Member States work constructively to ensure that the Human Rights Council remains relevant and effective in safeguarding the human rights of all people. \\u201cAmid the political and philosophical debates, let us place at the centre our shared responsibility to promote and protect the rights of all people as well as to address violations, including gross and systematic violations around the world. The Human Rights Council should continue to be central in our efforts.\\u201d (spoke in French) In accordance with resolution 65/281, of 17 June 2011, I now give the floor to Mr. Maza Martelli, President of the Human Rights Council. \",\n\"{'Action': 7.369496302089829e-08, 'ActionObject': 3.880267840372653e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 4.536369999641465e-07, 'Body': 1.6853106687975128e-09, 'Clarification': 7.963159731616543e-08, 'Conclusion': 2.26479954790193e-08, 'Election': 1.9400951600800909e-07, 'General': 0.9999741315841675, 'Introduction': 2.168781247746665e-05, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.4931487157809897e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 7.987285499666541e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 1.8030128501322906e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 2.4924825083871838e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 5.970505156938088e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.1554234013999576e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 7.624893783031439e-08, 'RVRequested': 4.978655265830412e-09, 'RVTaken': 3.187305974705623e-09, 'Session': 8.655736571938633e-09, 'Sponsorship': 3.0457834032660003e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.0931911020861662e-07, 'Vote': 5.4139178473633365e-08, 'VotingIntention': 3.344175638630986e-07}\",\n[[\"Miroslav Laj\\u010d\\u00e1k\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Joaqu\\u00edn Alexander Maza Martelli\", \"PERSON\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"A/72/53\", \"Symbol\"], [\"A/72/53/Add.1\", \"Symbol\"], [\"resolutions,\", \"R\"], [\"third\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"three\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"three\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"\\u2018Human rights are crucial; neither peace nor development can take hold without them\\u2019\", \"Entitled\"], [\"p. 6\", \"PARA\"], [\"\\u2018We the peoples\\u2019\", \"Entitled\"], [\"resolution 65/281\", \"R\"], [\"17\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Maza Martelli\", \"PERSON\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 286,\n            'f': \"286\",\n        },\n\"A_72_PV-40-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 15,\n            'f': \"15\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999793767929077,\n            'f': \"0.9999793767929077\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Maza Martelli (President, Human Rights Council) (spoke in Spanish): It is an honour to introduce the annual report of the Human Rights Council (A/72/53 and A/72/53/Add.1) to the General Assembly. I would like to begin by congratulating the 15 recently elected members of the Human Rights Council. I have full confidence that all members of the Council will work hard to uphold the promotion and protection of human rights. At the beginning of my presidency, I articulated what would give meaning to my mission in the Council: promoting universal respect for the protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind; addressing situations of violations of human rights, including gross and systematic violations; promoting the effective coordination and the mainstreaming of human rights within the United Nations system; and guiding the Council\\u2019s work in favour of the principles of universality, impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity, constructive international dialogue and cooperation. These principles of resolution 60/251 have guided my presidency this year. The work of the Human Rights Council is summarized in the report, which contains the activities, resolutions, decisions and President\\u2019s statements adopted by the Council at its regular sessions this year, as well as the special session held on 14 December 2016. During the year, the Human Rights Council offered proactive responses to human rights issues through its country-specific and thematic mandates. Over the course of its three regular sessions, the Council adopted a total of 114 resolutions, 80 of which were adopted without a vote. Under its Universal Periodic Review mechanism, by the end of the year, the Council will have reviewed the fulfilment of human rights obligations by 28 member States. I am also happy to report that the Council once again saw increased participation from small island developing States and least developed countries, thanks to the Voluntary Technical Assistance Trust Fund to Support Participation of Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States in the work of the Human Rights Council, which supported 27 representatives and Fellows from 26 countries. Among the country-specific situations that the Council addressed this year, the situation in Myanmar deserved special attention. In addition to the report and the oral update of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, during its thirty- fourth session, the Council created an independent international fact-finding mission \\u201cto establish the facts and circumstances of the alleged recent human rights violations by military and security forces, and abuses, in Myanmar, in particular in Rakhine state\\u201d, pursuant to Council resolution 34/22. Subsequent to hearing the oral update of and holding an interactive dialogue with the fact-finding mission during its thirty-sixth session, the Council decided to extend the mission\\u2019s mandate until September 2018. The Human Rights Council also considered the human rights situation in Syria. Interactive dialogues with the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic were held during all three of its regular sessions this year. The Council also extended the mandate of the Commission for another year. Moreover, during its thirty-fourth session, the Council held a panel discussion that provided an opportunity for victims to give their testimony on specific cases of enforced disappearances and arbitrary detention, and, in September, the Council decided to convene a high-level panel discussion on violations of the human rights of children in the Syrian Arab Republic at the thirty-seventh session, to be held in March 2018. In the light of the findings of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan and considering the human rights situation there, on 14 December 2016 the Council held a special session on the situation of human rights in that country. During its thirty-fourth session, in March of this year, the Council considered the comprehensive written report of the Commission on Human Rights, which was followed by an interactive dialogue. The Council subsequently extended the mandate of the Commission for another year and requested that, inter alia, it collect and preserve evidence of alleged gross violations and abuses of human rights and make such information available to all transitional justice mechanisms, pursuant to Council resolution 34/25. The Council also urged the speedy establishment of an independent hybrid court by the African Union Commission to investigate and prosecute those responsible for violations or abuses of international human rights and international humanitarian law, also pursuant to Council resolution 34/25. The Council examined the oral update and the report of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, which was established in 2016 to conduct a thorough investigation into human rights violations and abuses in Burundi since April 2015, including on their extent and whether they may constitute international crimes, with a view to contributing to the fight against impunity and to identifying alleged perpetrators of human rights violations and abuses in Burundi with a view to ensuring full accountability, in accordance with Council resolution 33/24. In September, the Council extended the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry for another year. The Council also decided to request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to urgently dispatch a team of three experts to engage with the Burundian authorities and all other stakeholders to collect and preserve information and to forward it to the judicial authorities of Burundi in order to establish the truth and ensure that the perpetrators of deplorable crimes are all accountable to the judicial authorities of Burundi, in accordance with Council resolution 36/2. In relation to the reports of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People\\u2019s Republic of Korea and the group of independent experts on accountability for human rights violations in that country, the Council decided at its thirty-fourth session to strengthen the capacity of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Seoul so as to allow the implementation of the relevant recommendations made by the group of independent experts on accountability in its report, in accordance with Council resolution 34/24. Additionally, the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People\\u2019s Republic of Korea was extended for another year. Concerning the situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, at its thirty-fifth session, the Council requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to dispatch a team of international experts, including experts from the region, to collect and preserve information to determine the facts and circumstances concerning alleged human rights violations and abuses, and violations of international humanitarian law, in the Kasai regions, pursuant to Council resolution 35/33. This year, the Council has also requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue to assess progress on the implementation of its recommendations and other relevant processes related to reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka, and invited the High Commissioner to continue to report on the situations of human rights in Ukraine and in Libya. Through a resolution, the Council also requested that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights continue to provide technical assistance to Georgia through the operations of its Office in that country. Regarding the human rights situation in Yemen, in September the Council requested that the High Commissioner establish a group of eminent international and regional experts with knowledge on human rights law and the context of Yemen, in order to monitor and report on the situation of human rights, make recommendations on improving the protection of human rights and engage with Yemeni authorities and all stakeholders, pursuant to Council resolution 36/31. The Council has extended the existing country- specific special procedures mandates on Belarus, Cambodia, the Central African Republic, Eritrea, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Mali, Somalia and the Sudan. During this year\\u2019s high-level panel discussion on promoting the mainstreaming of human rights throughout the United Nations system, the Council discussed the contribution of human rights to peacebuilding through the enhancement of dialogue and international cooperation for the promotion of human rights. The Council was honoured to have the President of the General Assembly and the Assistant Secretary- General for Peacebuilding Support participate in the discussion, which has contributed to the sharing of experiences between Geneva and New York. In 2017, the Human Rights Council has also continued to address a number of global issues, including human rights, in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, through thematic debates and panel discussions, for example, in panel discussions on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals in relation to the rights of the child and women\\u2019s rights, as well as the integration of a gender perspective throughout the work of the Human Rights Council and that of its mechanisms. In other panel discussions, including intersessional ones, the following topics were discussed: climate change; public health and access to medicines; unaccompanied migrant children and adolescents; racial profiling and incitement to hatred, including in the context of migration; the death penalty; the role of local Governments; the effects of terrorism on the enjoyment of all human rights; unilateral coercive measures; and the impact of multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence in the context of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related forms of intolerance on the full enjoyment of all human rights by women and girls. Throughout those discussions, the Council promoted universal respect for the protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. This year, the Council established a new special-procedures mandate, namely, the Special Rapporteur on the elimination of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members, pursuant to Council resolution 35/9. However, the Council did not extend the mandates of the Independent Expert on C\\u00f4te d\\u2019Ivoire or the Independent Expert on Haiti. I wish to take this opportunity to emphasize that the special procedures of the Human Rights Council not only provide one of the main sources of reliable information on human rights issues and situations around the world and a solid basis for dialogues and debates at the Council, but also contribute significantly to United Nations early-warning and prevention efforts. It is important that all countries cooperate with and grant access to these special-procedures mandate-holders so that they are able to carry out their work efficiently. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that, to date, 118 Member States and one observer State have issued standing invitations to thematic special procedures. However, I am concerned by the position of some States in not cooperating with the Council\\u2019s mechanisms or cooperating only with a select few. I call upon all States that have not yet done so to issue standing invitations to the special-procedures mandate-holders and fully cooperate with the Council\\u2019s mechanisms. Allow me now to turn to the Universal Periodic Review, the peer-review mechanism regarded as one of the greatest achievements of the Human Rights Council. The third cycle of the Universal Periodic Review began in May, and we will open the twenty-eighth session of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review next Monday. With 100 per cent participation over the first two cycles, the Universal Periodic Review is a true celebration of the principle of universality. We have witnessed very positive developments; for example, there has been an increased focus on the follow-up and implementation of recommendations and the use of development assistance by States themselves in order to facilitate follow-up activities at the national level. Furthermore, to date, 66 States have voluntarily submitted Universal Periodic Review mid-term reports in relation to recommendations put forward during the first and second cycles. I hope that these good practices continue and that they are strengthened throughout the third cycle. I am very pleased that the Secretary- General has underscored, in his reports to the current session of the General Assembly, the importance of the Universal Periodic Review process in connection with the Sustainable Development Goals. At its thirty-fifth session, the Human Rights Council acknowledged the crucial role that parliaments play in incorporating international commitments into national policies and laws, including by supporting the implementation of recommendations supported by States concerned in the framework of the Universal Periodic Review. Furthermore, a resolution was adopted on the contribution of parliaments to the work of the Human Rights Council and its Universal Periodic Review. The active participation of civil society and national human rights institutions is a core aspect of the work of the Human Rights Council. In addition to providing us with first-hand information from the field, interjecting unique perspectives into our discussions and drawing our attention to urgent human rights situations, they play a fundamental role in follow-up and capacity- building efforts in their home countries. I wish to inform the Assembly that I have received allegations of intimidation, threats and reprisals against individuals who seek to cooperate or have cooperated with the Human Rights Council and its mechanisms, matters on which I have followed up directly with the States concerned. It is essential that duly accredited representatives of civil society and national human rights institutions be provided with a safe space to allow their voices to be heard, as well as to interact with other stakeholders. I regularly remind States that acts of intimidation and reprisals against individuals or groups that participate in the work of the Council or its mechanisms are unacceptable, and I call on them to take all necessary measures to prevent and ensure adequate protection against such acts. This year, the Human Rights Council adopted several resolutions with recommendations made to the General Assembly. Through the resolution adopted in March on the human rights situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, the Human Rights Council recommended that the General Assembly submit the reports of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria to the Security Council for appropriate action (Council resolution 34/26). In its resolution on ensuring accountability and justice for all violations of international law in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, also adopted in March, the Council recommended that the General Assembly \\u201cremain apprised of the matter until it is satisfied that appropriate action with regard to implementing the recommendations made by the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict in its report has been or is being taken appropriately at the national or international levels to ensure justice for victims and accountability for perpetrators\\u201d (Council resolution 34/28, para. 9). In March, the Council also recommended that the General Assembly invite States located in the regions where people of African descent live and of which they are citizens to offer to host regional conferences on the establishment of the forum of people of African descent with the participation of people of African descent with a view to making substantive contributions on the format, structure and content of the proposed forum. Furthermore, through its resolution on the seventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted at its thirty-fifth session, the Council invited the General Assembly to consider holding a special commemorative meeting on the occasion of the anniversaries. Finally, with regard to the situations of human rights in Eritrea and Burundi, the Council has requested the General Assembly to submit the reports and oral updates of the respective commissions of inquiry to all relevant organs of the United Nations for consideration and appropriate action, pursuant to Council resolutions 35/35 and 36/19, respectively. Before concluding, I wish to highlight the increasing challenges that the Human Rights Council is facing with regard to the growing gap between the workload entailed in servicing the Human Rights Council and the resources allocated to the United Nations Office at Geneva and the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management. With a view to finding solutions to this issue, a joint task force was established in May, comprising a representative of the Bureau of the Human Rights Council and representatives of the United Nations Office at Geneva and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Based on the report and recommendations of the task force, in September, the Bureau presented various proposed measures, including substantive time-saving measures, to the Council for its consideration. Despite holding several consultations on the proposals, including within the framework of a Council meeting on 20 October, it has not been possible to reach consensus on the proposed measures at this stage. Further Council consultations, to be held under the leadership of the next Bureau, will be required with a view to adopting sustainable measures to allow the Human Rights Council to carry out its work more efficiently. As the Secretary-General told the Security Council in January, \\u201cthe interconnected nature of today\\u2019s crises requires us to connect our own efforts for peace and security, sustainable development and human rights not just in words, but in practice (S/PV.7857, p. 3)\\u201d. Today, when the world is facing many complex crises with human rights dimensions, the work of the Human Rights Council, as the premier United Nations forum on human rights, is essential to the international community\\u2019s efforts aimed at achieving peace, security and development. I therefore call on all States Members of the United Nations to focus their full and devoted attention to this issue. I take this opportunity to thank the General Assembly for its consistent support for the Human Rights Council and its work, and express my most sincere hope that this support will continue throughout the rest of this year, as well as in the years to come. \",\n\"{'Action': 5.389607622419135e-07, 'ActionObject': 1.3167608869935066e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 7.603508720421814e-07, 'Body':

behalf of the Group of African States. The African Group welcomes this opportunity to have a dialogue with the President of the Human Rights Council, His Excellency Ambassador Maza Martelli, on the annual report of the Council\\u2019s activities during its eleventh cycle year (A/72/53). We also appreciate the vision and leadership role played by the presidency in carrying out its mandate to support the work of the Council. The African Group would like to reaffirm the Council\\u2019s mandate as the principal United Nations body of first instance responsible for universal respect for the protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind and in a fair and equal manner, as enshrined in the founding resolution 60/251. We wish to recall that the Council\\u2018s mandate should be driven by the principles of cooperation and genuine dialogue, free from politicization, selectivity and double standards. Africa remains convinced that the Universal Periodic Review is a pillar of the work of the Human Rights Council in the fulfilment of States\\u2019 human rights obligations and in the improvement of the situation on the ground. In realizing these objectives, the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance in the implementation of the Universal Periodic Review must be provided with adequate resources so as to be able to assist States develop their national capacity and expertise for the implementation of the Council\\u2019s recommendations. The African Group reaffirms its endorsement of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted at the third World Conference on Human Rights, on 25 June 1993. This outcome fundamentally underlines that, first, all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, and that, secondly, the right to development are a universal, inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights. Furthermore, Africa fully subscribes to the terms of paragraph 14 of the Vienna Declaration, which states that, \\u201c[t]he existence of widespread extreme poverty inhibits the full and effective enjoyment of human rights; its immediate alleviation and eventual elimination must remain a high priority for the international community.\\u201d We are encouraged by the Council\\u2019s work in the area of the practical enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, which remains key to eradicating extreme poverty, inequality and underdevelopment worldwide, and we are of the view that more can be done in this area. The African Group places a high premium on the principle of constructive dialogue and international cooperation aimed at practically assisting States to fulfil their human rights obligations. The purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations impel us to promote global solidarity and to act towards one another in the spirit of concrete international cooperation, especially with a view towards achieving socioeconomic progress in the developing world. The African Group\\u2019s principled position on the notion of the justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights and their progressive realization is informed by the recognition that extreme poverty and social exclusion constitute a violation of human dignity and that urgent steps must be taken to achieve better understanding of extreme poverty and its causes. A troubling aspect of this is the negation of socioeconomic and cultural rights. We do not believe in a hierarchy of rights, which is consistent with the premise of the human rights-based approach. We cannot promote one set of rights to the exclusion of others and hope to achieve the inculcation of human rights consciousness throughout the entire world. At this juncture, the Group would like to reaffirm the mandate of the Third Committee to examine the work of the Human Rights Council through the adoption of its annual report. We have noted increasing attempts to undermine this mandate by proposing that the report of the Human Rights Council be submitted to the General Assembly without the endorsement of the Committee. The Group therefore wishes to caution against establishing such a dangerous precedent for the methods of work of the General Assembly and its subsidiary bodies. Any changes to this mandate would require the endorsement of the universal membership through an inclusive intergovernmental process. To this end, the African Group will continue to present its annual draft resolution towards the adoption of the report of the Human Rights Council. In conclusion, we assure the presidency of the General Assembly of our support and cooperation as it leads the Council towards the fulfilment of its mandate. \",\n\"{'Action': 4.742072690078203e-08, 'ActionObject': 6.290846954470908e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 5.096312634123024e-07, 'Body': 1.882225486582456e-09, 'Clarification': 9.575267512218488e-08, 'Conclusion': 2.7554531101259272e-08, 'Election': 1.4321963703878282e-07, 'General': 0.999994158744812, 'Introduction': 1.9099923065368785e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.1454691417611684e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 5.233011535210608e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 1.5506062212011784e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 2.5766989892872516e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 4.1280863172232785e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.2139439320435486e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.3087046940872824e-08, 'RVRequested': 2.7961595261416505e-09, 'RVTaken': 4.3348844513957374e-09, 'Session': 1.1568800140082658e-08, 'Sponsorship': 8.419106301005286e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.356263889031652e-08, 'Vote': 1.496186285976364e-08, 'VotingIntention': 2.6892996629612753e-07}\",\n[[\"Giorgio\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Eritrea\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Maza Martelli\", \"PERSON\"], [\"annual\", \"DATE\"], [\"eleventh\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"A/72/53\", \"Symbol\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"resolution 60/251\", \"R\"], [\"25 June 1993\", \"DATE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"secondly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"paragraph 14\", \"PARA\"], [\"promote one\", \"PARA\"], [\"Third Committee\", \"C\"], [\"annual\", \"DATE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 289,\n            'f': \"289\",\n        },\n\"A_72_PV-40-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 18,\n            'f': \"18\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999198913574219,\n            'f': \"0.9999198913574219\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The Acting President (spoke in French): I now give the floor to the observer of the European Union.\",\n\"{'Action': 2.5821313975882276e-09, 'ActionObject': 2.477091598507286e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 5.078655249235453e-06, 'Body': 5.529922297853318e-09, 'Clarification': 7.84058951097677e-09, 'Conclusion': 2.683664888536441e-06, 'Election': 9.15134545920182e-09, 'General': 5.5907556088641286e-05, 'Introduction': 0.9999198913574219, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.0341731077344605e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 1.919749514911473e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 1.1920269216147972e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 6.660339749942068e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 1.923451442564783e-08, 'OralStatement': 5.051859538335313e-12, 'PresidingOfficer': 8.495593419866054e-07, 'RVRequested': 6.531217877636664e-06, 'RVTaken': 3.298567641252248e-09, 'Session': 1.0961747065607597e-09, 'Sponsorship': 2.6950454021235082e-11, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.1880885014979867e-06, 'Vote': 3.362890410585351e-08, 'VotingIntention': 1.3467463588767714e-07}\",\n[[\"the European Union\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 290,\n            'f': \"290\",\n        },\n\"A_72_PV-40-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 19,\n            'f': \"19\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999979734420776,\n            'f': \"0.9999979734420776\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Brito Maneira (European Union): The European Union (EU) would like to thank the President of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador Maza Martelli, for presenting the Council\\u2019s twelfth annual report to the General Assembly (A/72/53). The candidate countries Montenegro and Albania, and the country of the Stabilization and Association Process and potential candidate Bosnia and Herzegovina, align themselves with this statement. The European Union has strongly supported the Human Rights Council since its establishment, and it continues to do so. Eleven years have passed since the General Assembly established the Council, and much has been achieved. The system of special procedures, the establishment of accountability mechanisms, the Universal Periodic Review and all other mechanisms of the Council have contributed positively to the promotion and protection of human rights worldwide. Through the delivery of technical assistance and capacity-building mandates, it has also helped countries faced with human rights crises build human rights protection policies and fulfil their international obligations. The Council has been entrusted with the mandate of promoting universal respect for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind and in a fair and equal manner. Also part of its mandate is addressing situations of violations of human rights, including gross and systematic violations and making recommendations thereon. Furthermore, the Council should also promote the effective coordination and mainstreaming of human rights within the United Nations system. There is further potential to strengthen dialogue and synergies between the Human Rights Council and the Security Council so as to ensure that human rights are central to every United Nations action. The Human Rights Council\\u2019s mandate to contribute to preventing human rights violations through dialogue and cooperation and to respond promptly to human rights emergencies must be fully operationalized so as to translate early warning into early action. The Council\\u2019s existing mechanisms can be better used to play this stronger prevention role. The European Union looks forward to continuing to contribute to the full implementation of the Council\\u2019s wide mandate granted under its founding resolution 60/251. Calls for enhancing and strengthening the effectiveness of the Human Rights Council have steadily increased over the past few years. The EU is firmly committed to engaging constructively in an inclusive cross-regional process of reflection, dialogue and review coordinated from Geneva, focusing on the body\\u2019s working methods, efficiency, effectiveness and impact. The outcomes of such a Geneva-coordinated process would then help inform action deemed necessary in New York. The Secretary-General addressed the Council during its high-level segment in March, alerting us all to the fact that disregard for human rights is a disease that is spreading north, south, east and west, and he continued to say that the Human Rights Council must be part of the cure. The Council is indeed part of the cure. Commissions of inquiry and fact-finding missions have been established to respond to serious allegations of human rights violations and abuses around the world. The system of independent special-procedures mandate holders are our eyes and ears, contributing to a global early warning system that gives us indications of emerging crises and assisting countries in respecting, protecting and fulfilling their human rights obligations. The European Union will continue to make every effort to ensure that the Human Rights Council is not only able to help prevent or address human rights violations and abuses, including gross and systematic ones, as well as respond promptly to human rights emergencies, but also improve human rights standards and their implementation worldwide through systematic work on relevant thematic issues. In this context, the EU recalls the importance of the independence of the Council and strongly opposes any attempts to undermine the institutional position of the Council within the United Nations system. The European Union welcomes the central role played by the Human Rights Council in addressing human rights situations throughout the world. The severe consequences of the crisis in Syria and the violations committed by all parties, particularly the Syrian regime and its allies, cannot be ignored by any State. Any breaches of international law, in particular international humanitarian law and human rights law, some of which may constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity, must be brought to justice. In this context, the Council\\u2019s ongoing response to the crisis remains critically important, as demonstrated by efforts to foster accountability and fight against impunity. The European Union welcomes the decision reached by consensus during the last session of the Human Rights Council to request the High Commissioner for Human Rights to establish a group of eminent international and regional experts to monitor and report on the human rights situation in Yemen, carry out a comprehensive examination of all alleged violations and abuses of international human rights law and other appropriate and applicable fields of international law committed by all parties to the conflict, establish the facts and circumstances surrounding the alleged violations and abuses and, where possible, identify those responsible. We call on all parties to cooperate fully with the new investigative mechanism for Yemen. During the past year, the Human Rights Council has also demonstrated its commitment to promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka, and to providing technical assistance and capacity-building to promote human rights to the Governments of C\\u00f4te d\\u2019Ivoire, Haiti and Mali. Furthermore, we welcome the continued support that has been rendered to the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, the Republic of Guinea, Georgia, Libya and Ukraine. We trust that the Council will continue to closely monitor situations where technical assistance and capacity-building can make a difference and take action where necessary. Civil society and human rights defenders play a crucial role in the work of the Council and its mechanisms, as provided for in the 2007 institution-building package. Targeting individuals or groups that engage with United Nations human rights mechanisms is deplorable and runs contrary to the promotion and protection of human rights. The EU strongly condemns any act of violence, harassment, intimidation, reprisal or threat thereof. The ability of individuals and groups to raise concerns with special procedures without fear is vital for the work of these mechanisms and their capacity to fulfil their mandates. The issue of reprisals needs a consistent approach at the international and regional levels; we must do our utmost to prevent and eliminate such acts. Civil society and its representatives are valuable partners for human right mechanisms and the protection and promotion of human rights. We therefore welcome the work done by Andrew Gilmour, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, in the role designated by the Secretary- General to receive, consider and respond to allegations of intimidation and reprisals against those seeking to cooperate with the United Nations and its mechanisms. The EU will continue to support their engagement with the Council and the human rights mechanisms. On 16 October, the General Assembly elected 15 new members of the Council (see A/72/PV.31). Serving as a Council member entails important responsibilities. Resolution 60/251 provides that members elected to the Council shall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights and fully cooperate with the Council. While we congratulate the new members, we also remind them to pay careful attention to the human rights situations in their own countries and to cooperate with the Council mechanisms in the promotion and protection of the human rights of all, without discrimination of any kind. No State has a perfect human rights record, and we therefore encourage the newly elected members to engage in the work of the Council in a spirit of self- reflection, with a view to the improvement of our own human rights situation and to address all human rights concerns that come before the Council on the basis of their merits. We also strongly encourage all States and other stakeholders to cooperate with the special procedures as a means to enhance the protection and promotion of human rights. We take this opportunity to call on all States that have not yet done so to extend a standing invitation to all special procedures. We welcome the fact that the Human Rights Council is seized of the serious human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and underline the importance of the mechanism established on accountability concerning events in the Kasai regions. We urge the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to fully cooperate with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the international expert group in this regard. Membership of the Council increases the responsibilities of the holder to cooperate with Council mechanisms and adhere to international norms and obligations. The EU welcomes the renewal of the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi and calls on the Government of Burundi, as a member of the Council, to cooperate fully with the Commission of Inquiry as well as with other international human rights mechanisms. As stated in the Council\\u2019s founding resolution, members of the Human Rights Council should uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights, both domestically and internationally, and we reiterate our urgent call on the Government of Burundi to do so. The EU welcomes the creation of an independent international fact-finding mission to establish the facts and circumstances of the alleged recent human rights violations and abuses by military and security forces and abuses in Myanmar, particularly in Rakhine state, with a view to ensuring full accountability for perpetrators and justice for victims. The EU takes the opportunity to call once again on the Government of Myanmar to cooperate with this mission. We also welcome the extensions of the country- specific mandates of the Special Rapporteurs on the situations of human rights in Myanmar, Iran, the Democratic People\\u2019s Republic of Korea, Eritrea and Belarus and the extension of the mandate of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan. In this regard, it is important to recall the special session held in December 2016 following allegations of ethnic cleansing, including claims of sexual violence of an unprecedented severity and scale. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate our continued commitment to the work of the Human Rights Council and to further strengthening the Council\\u2019s role in the protection and promotion of human rights, the development of international human rights law and in the prevention of human rights violations and abuses. We will continue to systematically uphold and ensure the implementation of existing international norms and standards, and at all times strongly defend the universality, indivisibility, interdependency, inalienability and interrelated character of human rights. \",\n\"{'Action': 9.899264519219741e-09, 'ActionObject': 9.498609898628274e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 8.960319064499345e-08, 'Body': 4.242896867179269e-10, 'Clarification': 2.6459236579512435e-08, 'Conclusion': 1.0477926970509088e-08, 'Election': 3.375015111828361e-08, 'General': 0.9999979734420776, 'Introduction': 8.556820034755219e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 3.132302861530434e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 2.1616164858073716e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 4.766435690584103e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 8.635849439997401e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 1.0257642735211903e-08, 'OralStatement': 2.3400172466381264e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 6.876666347466198e-09, 'RVRequested': 6.510222361200135e-10, 'RVTaken': 1.241851510513925e-09, 'Session': 4.437751055519357e-09, 'Sponsorship': 3.301084738893678e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 6.994677281824124e-09, 'Vote': 8.339913648569564e-09, 'VotingIntention': 1.2340535704424838e-07}\",\n[[\"Brito Maneira\", \"PERSON\"], [\"European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Maza Martelli\", \"PERSON\"], [\"twelfth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"A/72/53\", \"Symbol\"], [\"Montenegro\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Albania\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Bosnia and Herzegovina\", \"UNPE\"], [\"European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Eleven years\", \"DATE\"], [\"European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"resolution 60/251\", \"R\"], [\"the past few years\", \"DATE\"], [\"March\", \"DATE\"], [\"European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Yemen\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Yemen\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the past year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sri Lanka\", \"UNPE\"], [\"C\\u00f4te d\\u2019Ivoire\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Haiti\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Mali\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the Republic of Guinea\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Georgia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Libya\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Ukraine\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2007\", \"DATE\"], [\"Andrew Gilmour\", \"PERSON\"], [\"16 October\", \"DATE\"], [\"15\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Resolution 60/251\", \"R\"], [\"the Democratic Republic of the Congo\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kasai\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the Democratic Republic of the Congo\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Burundi\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Burundi\", \"UNPE\"], [\"resolution,\", \"R\"], [\"Burundi\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Myanmar\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Rakhine\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Myanmar\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Myanmar\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the Democratic People\\u2019s Republic of Korea\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Eritrea\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Belarus\", \"UNPE\"], [\"South Sudan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"December 2016\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 291,\n            'f': \"291\",\n        },\n\"A_72_PV-40-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 20,\n            'f': \"20\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999955892562866,\n            'f': \"0.9999955892562866\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Al-Thani (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): First of all, I would like to express once again Qatar\\u2019s indignation at and condemnation of the act of terrorism perpetrated in New York. We express our most sincere sympathy to the victims and to the Government and the people of the United States, and we trust that the injured will recover rapidly. We wish to state that Qatar stands with the United States and supports all steps taken to safeguard peace and stability. I would like to say that we greatly appreciate the words of Ambassador Maza Martelli, President of the Human Rights Council. We thank him for his work, which has been described in the comprehensive and noteworthy report (A/72/53 and A/72/53/Add.1). Qatar continues to participate in the work of the Human Rights Council as a member. We have been elected once again for the new 2018-2020 term, and we are determined to continue our effective work in the Council to promote fundamental rights and freedoms. We pay tribute to the work being done by the Council in accordance with the principles of neutrality, objectivity and impartiality. We shall continue to cooperate with members of the Council in order to enable the Council to execute its mandate pursuant to those principles. Qatar plays its role in striving to fulfil the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations with respect to the protection of human rights, the maintenance of international peace and security and the achievement of development. My country incorporates those concepts in its policies and in its Constitution, seeking to strengthen human rights and fundamental freedoms while ensuring respect for such rights and the protection of all. We achieve that end by means of our national institutions, which effectively contribute to the implementation of Government policy for the promotion and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We cooperate with other States and with United Nations mechanisms on the basis of our open-door policy to welcome those holding mandates related to human rights. The Qatar National Vision 2030 is therefore founded on the strategic approach that human rights are fundamental to education, health care, the environment, workers\\u2019 rights, the empowerment of women and the rights of the child, of those with special needs and of the elderly. Vesting its trust in international cooperation on human rights, Qatar welcomes the establishment of the United Nations Human Rights Training and Documentation Centre for South-West Asia and the Arab Region on 12 February 2006, pursuant to resolution 60/153. The Centre plays an important role and is respected by the United Nations and other relevant institutions. The report of the Human Rights Council submitted to the General Assembly reflects the difficult situation in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem. Establishing peace in the Middle East must involve respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights law in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem. The relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council must also be observed. The report of the Human Rights Council also mentions the serious deterioration of the human rights situation in Syria and the serious and systematic violations being committed on a large scale. The Syrian people must be protected and the ceasefire must continue. As we believe in the primacy of law and the principles of justice and human dignity, and since we are fully aware of the importance of human rights to the stability and prosperity of societies, we have been careful to adopt a consistent approach in order to promote human rights in cooperation with institutions of States Members of the United Nations. Qatar has made major strides nationally, regionally and internationally in that regard. However, we still face illegal and unilateral measures against my country, which constitute a serious violation of human rights owing to their negative consequences, as established by the National Human Rights Committee in Qatar, in the areas of education, health care, the dispersal of families and restrictions on freedom of movement and residence. Given those negative effects on human rights, the international community must ensure that international law is observed by preventing the imposition on States of policies that seek to flout international human rights standards. Such policies adopted against a State such as ours, which plays a pivotal role in implementing the objectives of the United Nations, undermine international efforts to promote human rights. In conclusion, we reiterate our support for the promotion of human rights in an impartial and objective way and our cooperation with international organizations such as the United Nations, the Human Rights Council and other specialized bodies. \",\n\"{'Action': 4.9658666512186755e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.0392680138693322e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 1.114506247290592e-07, 'Body': 1.7167688382002666e-09, 'Clarification': 9.706685233368262e-08, 'Conclusion': 2.001117138661357e-08, 'Election': 6.344841096961318e-08, 'General': 0.9999955892562866, 'Introduction': 1.4732070212630788e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.297649454556904e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 4.032603584391836e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 8.483597824238132e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 2.055415961876861e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 1.807131511100124e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.1001339572658253e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.5520285501224862e-08, 'RVRequested': 1.4179135643388463e-09, 'RVTaken': 3.984844898496931e-09, 'Session': 7.657906309077589e-09, 'Sponsorship': 3.336043263857391e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 4.5307533724781024e-08, 'Vote': 1.432178553528729e-08, 'VotingIntention': 3.995968427261687e-07}\",\n[[\"Al-Thani\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Qatar\", \"UNPE\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Qatar\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Qatar\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Maza Martelli\", \"PERSON\"], [\"A/72/53\", \"Symbol\"], [\"A/72/53/Add.1\", \"Symbol\"], [\"Qatar\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2018-2020\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Qatar\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Qatar\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Qatar\", \"UNPE\"], [\"12 February 2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolution 60/153\", \"R\"], [\"Qatar\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Qatar\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 292,\n            'f': \"292\",\n        },\n\"A_72_PV-40-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 21,\n            'f': \"21\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 1.0,\n            'f': \"1.0\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Wilson (Australia): I have the pleasure of delivering this statement on behalf of Canada, Iceland, Liechtenstein, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and my own country, Australia. We take this opportunity to reaffirm our support for the Human Rights Council as the pre-eminent United Nations forum for consideration, discussion and action on human rights. At this time of increasing polarization, populism and fundamentalism, it is crucial that States Members of the United Nations safeguard the integrity of the Human Rights Council. The Council plays a crucial role in highlighting deteriorating human rights situations and in calling on States to uphold their responsibility to protect their populations and their obligations to respect and to ensure human rights. The Council provides the most appropriate forum to affirm that international human rights apply equally to all people regardless of their race, religion, creed, disability, sexuality or gender identity, including online. Without the Council, the international human rights discourse would be poorer, human rights violations would go unrecorded and the voiceless would remain so. We underscore the importance of the Council\\u2019s direct reporting relationship with the plenary of the General Assembly, in accordance with resolution 65/281. We call upon Member States to join us in acknowledging and in respecting the separate mandate of the Human Rights Council. We also take this opportunity to emphasize that members of the Human Rights Council should uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights, as mandated by resolution 60/251. No State has all the answers when it comes to the protection and promotion of human rights. There is room for us all to improve our records and the situations faced by our citizens. However, the tolerance of, acquiescence to or the commission of gross and systemic violations is always reprehensible. Such behaviour should not be accepted or condoned by members of the Human Rights Council. Being a member of the Council is a privilege that allows States to drive the global human rights agenda. Our countries support the ongoing discussion about how the Human Rights Council could be reformed to secure its continued status as a respected advocate for human rights. In our national capacity, we would like to note that Australia was recently elected to the Human Rights Council for the 2018-2020 term. As a member, Australia will take a pragmatic and principled approach to the Council and continue to defend human rights both at home and abroad. We will not shy away from difficult issues in our own human rights record, and we will strongly encourage other Council members to do the same. Our membership term will be characterized by consultations with civil society, national human rights institutions and human rights defenders. Our seven countries are deeply concerned by the increasing hostility to civil society and human rights defenders, both online and offline. Without these key actors, the Human Rights Council would have little to no visibility of the lived experiences of individual rights- holders in any country. We reject reprisals against any person cooperating or seeking to cooperate with the United Nations human rights mechanisms or agencies outright, including when these reprisals arise out of participation in the Human Rights Council, contributions to its Universal Periodic Review or engagement with the Council\\u2019s special-procedures mandates. We are also deeply concerned by the harassment, intimidation and obstruction shown by States to special-procedures mandate-holders. While special procedures must be even-handed and fair and operate in line with their mandates, a mandate-holder is an independent voice. It is the mandate-holder\\u2019s job to shine a spotlight on human rights abuses and violations, research and report on worrying trends, encourage new norms and share expertise and best practices with the global community. We therefore call upon all States to work constructively with the special procedures of the Human Rights Council, grant access where required, consider their recommendations in good faith and engage respectfully, even when common ground is difficult to find. All of our countries benefit from the scrutiny that the special procedures bring to bear. As we look towards the future, our nations believe that, if the Human Rights Council is going to remain effective, it must emphasize diversity and inclusion. It is not sufficient that human rights be enjoyed by members of majority groups but not minorities, by men but not women, or by adults but not children, adolescents or older persons. We have the tools in our hands, including the Council and the existing body of human rights treaties, to ensure that no one is left behind. We must focus on ensuring that human rights protections are enacted for all equally. That must include ensuring that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons enjoy equal protection of their rights and freedom from violence and discrimination; that people with disabilities are empowered to participate equally as contributors, leaders and decision-makers; and that the rights of indigenous peoples are respected and upheld. We must reject cultural relativism, calls for collective rights to trump individual rights, and arguments that sovereignty should obviate the need for international scrutiny. We urge States to look back at and consistently apply the agreed language in core international human rights instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, and to look forward and use the resolutions of the Human Rights Council and the Third Committee to ensure that human rights protections are inclusive and embrace our global diversity. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.8703802950881254e-09, 'ActionObject': 3.1564714730869525e-10, 'AgendaStatus': 2.2000665733656888e-09, 'Body': 9.39044068198891e-12, 'Clarification': 2.893439043916146e-09, 'Conclusion': 2.0328735916841367e-10, 'Election': 3.1186875304456407e-09, 'General': 1.0, 'Introduction': 6.210454372990171e-09, 'MeetingDateTime': 4.705093537005212e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 1.7236930771602488e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 1.5104124895248816e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 4.449073554013694e-09, 'MeetingStatus': 1.5180001700088042e-09, 'OralStatement': 3.8884713227105294e-09, 'PresidingOfficer': 4.414844601008383e-10, 'RVRequested': 4.369851702712424e-12, 'RVTaken': 4.634337011366618e-11, 'Session': 3.9353192926583347e-10, 'Sponsorship': 2.4946372745304757e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.8390264311385351e-10, 'Vote': 1.2231092805237154e-09, 'VotingIntention': 8.120517591692078e-09}\",\n[[\"Wilson\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Australia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Canada\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Iceland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Liechtenstein\", \"UNPE\"], [\"New Zealand\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Norway\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Switzerland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Australia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"resolution 65/281\", \"R\"], [\"resolution 60/251\", \"R\"], [\"Australia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2018-2020\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Australia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"seven\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Third Committee\", \"C\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 293,\n            'f': \"293\",\n        },\n\"A_72_PV-40-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 22,\n            'f': \"22\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999978542327881,\n            'f': \"0.9999978542327881\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): Given the breadth of its thematic activities and its responsiveness to human rights emergencies, as the report presented by the President of the Human Rights Council (A/72/53 and A/72/53/Add.1) illustrates, the Council is living up to its role as the central and permanent human rights body of the Organization. Since its creation, it has established itself as an authoritative voice in the promotion and protection of human rights, including through the truly Universal Periodic Review process, its body of special procedures and its close engagement with human rights defenders. The review of the Human Rights Council in 2011 confirmed the generally positive perception of the Council among the membership. We collectively refrained from an institutional overhaul and, instead, used the opportunity to strengthen the Council\\u2019s institutional standing in relation to the General Assembly and its Third Committee. A large majority of the Council\\u2019s decisions are taken autonomously and immediately implemented. But the Council also reports to the plenary of the General Assembly and feeds its recommendations into the dedicated General Assembly Committees, namely, the Third and Fifth Committees. We believe that such finely calibrated compromise has served both the Council and the Assembly well. We also see room for improvement in a number of areas. As pointed out by others, not all provisions of the Council\\u2019s founding resolution 60/251 have been implemented in practice. The resolution stipulates that Council members shall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights, which has been a political commitment for the General Assembly membership. We as States have to live up to that responsibility when electing the membership of the Council. We call upon States to publicly renew this commitment and adapt their election practices accordingly, as a contribution to strengthening the Council in its mission and its daily work. We also support calls for greater efficiency and effectiveness in the work and functioning of the Council. Its efficiency and impact on the ground can certainly benefit from a review of its working methods and a resetting of priorities. We welcome the effort undertaken in the framework of the Council itself in Geneva, which can and should build on experience and best practices from the entire United Nations system. We welcome the resolution adopted by the Council on the human rights situation in Myanmar, and in particular the decision to dispatch an independent, international fact-finding mission in order to establish the facts and circumstances of alleged human rights violations, especially in Rakhine state. The setting up of that mission is an important step towards ensuring both full accountability for perpetrators and justice for victims. Events since have illustrated that more and urgent action is needed, lest that decision prove to be too little, too late. We also welcome the resolution adopted by the Council on the situation in Yemen, and in particular the overdue establishment of an international, independent investigative body to carry out comprehensive, impartial and transparent investigations of atrocities and violations of international law. With that decision, the Council has finally shown its readiness to address the urgent situation in Yemen and has sent a clear signal for the need for accountability. Our commitment to the protection of human rights begins at the national level. The most significant recent measure is the creation in Liechtenstein of an independent national human rights institution, in accordance with the Paris Principles. We have therefore implemented the long-standing recommendations of various international human rights bodies. Our national human rights institution is being independently developed by civil society, without the involvement of the Government, while receiving funding from the State. Its responsibilities include advising public authorities and private parties on human rights issues, supporting victims of human rights violations, informing the public about the situation of human rights in the country, carrying out investigations, recommending measures to be taken, preparing comments on draft laws and ordinances and the ratification of international agreements, as well as promoting dialogue with national and international bodies. We are convinced that this new institution adds value to the protection of human rights and therefore further strengthens the high standards implicit in the concept of human rights and fundamental freedoms. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.3491697536949232e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.4342839804726282e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 1.6097226307465462e-07, 'Body': 7.152015091271835e-10, 'Clarification': 8.993055189421284e-08, 'Conclusion': 3.531969738901353e-08, 'Election': 1.7013743303095907e-08, 'General': 0.9999978542327881, 'Introduction': 4.6991760882519884e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 4.790186025616094e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 4.1588361199274004e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 5.578855155619067e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 5.416544013314706e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 1.6820340675849366e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.7011531383559486e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.2058477771859089e-08, 'RVRequested': 6.870146118664877e-10, 'RVTaken': 3.1001001765673664e-09, 'Session': 6.500484595051148e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.1141318978502568e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.0452357201984341e-08, 'Vote': 7.3934756095184184e-09, 'VotingIntention': 4.2975003111678234e-07}\",\n[[\"Wenaweser\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Liechtenstein\", \"UNPE\"], [\"A/72/53\", \"Symbol\"], [\"A/72/53/Add.1\", \"Symbol\"], [\"2011\", \"DATE\"], [\"Third Committee\", \"C\"], [\"Third\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"resolution 60/251\", \"R\"], [\"daily\", \"DATE\"], [\"Myanmar\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Rakhine\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Yemen\", \"UNPE\"], [\"decision,\", \"D\"], [\"Yemen\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Liechtenstein\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 294,\n            'f': \"294\",\n        },\n\"A_72_PV-40-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 23,\n            'f': \"23\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999946355819702,\n            'f': \"0.9999946355819702\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Lal (India): We welcome the President of the Human Rights Council, Mr. Maza Martelli, and thank him for his detailed statement. The Human Rights Council plays an important role in furthering our common cause of the promotion and protection of human rights for all. Even as the Human Rights Council has sought to overcome the challenges faced by its earlier avatar, its work has not been smooth and, regrettably, often proves to be contentious. The reasons for many of the difficulties surrounding the discussions on the human rights agenda are not hard to find: divergent priorities and concerns stem primarily from the very wide range of situations that exist in terms, for example, of member States\\u2019 levels of development, social and cultural contexts and governance systems. At the same time, the palette of human rights also represents an entire range of aspects, from civil and political, to economic, social and cultural rights and the right to development. The question of whether collective rights should be given priority over individual rights is sometimes debated. Agreeing on the right way to promote and protect human rights, including in situations of possible gross violations, is also difficult if it clashes with the idea of the sovereignty of States. Therefore, while the global discourse on human rights has continued to evolve, fundamental contradictions remain. The relative prioritization of the individual over the State, national sovereignty over international norms and a universal over a culture-specific approach evoke differing opinions. Constraints on national capacities to implement certain rights, instances of the politicization of human rights issues as a foreign policy tool and perceived intrusiveness beyond mandated activities remain areas of contention. While the international community has developed extensive institutional mechanisms and normative frameworks encompassing various aspects of human rights, there are also continuing calls for reform of some of these mechanisms, including the Human Rights Council itself. The momentum to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development and to prevent the gross violation of human rights in armed conflicts and terrorist attacks around the world over the past two decades has informed recent debates on human rights. This is witnessed in the somewhat contradictory approaches inherent in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, on the one hand, and the moves towards external action to prevent violations and abuses and protect civilians, on the other hand. Emerging technologies ranging from cyber- to genetic engineering to artificial intelligence will also soon inform such debates in view of their uneven impact on peoples\\u2019 lives and rights. The work of the Human Rights Council continues to expand. This is reflected in the large number of resolutions and decisions being adopted on a range of issues and the greater frequency of meetings and the holding of special sessions. The effectiveness of its work, however, is not always clear. There is a proliferation of special procedures on both thematic and country- specific situations. The work of the special procedures is often constrained by a lack of adequate funds, and the opacity of funding is also an area of concern. There is the problem of certain special procedures clearly exceeding their mandates. A more balanced representation in the staffing of institutions, such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), would add to their effectiveness. Further, the country-specific special procedures have largely been counterproductive, and the Council\\u2019s role in providing technical capacity-building has been limited to only a few situations. In that context, the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism counts as a significant success over the past decade of the Human Rights Council. Every Member State has presented its report at least once. Also, significantly, a number of specific recommendations emerging from this very interactive and constructive exercise have been implemented by a number of Member States in their domestic contexts. These are concrete instances of change occurring as a result of our collective work. This year, India presented the Universal Periodic Review of its human rights record \\u2014 its third in fewer than 10 years \\u2014 at the Human Rights Council in Geneva. Also this year, India presented its voluntary national review on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda at United Nations Headquarters. Both these voluntary and State-driven processes elicited wide interest and engagement. A similar voluntary aspect is behind the success of the climate-action contributions put forward by the parties to the landmark Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Each of the foregoing is an instance of constructive and collaborative engagement for shaping a better collective future. We believe that this cooperative spirit, rather than counterproductive and often politicized naming and shaming, is essential to enhancing the promotion and protection of human rights globally. India has engaged actively at the Human Rights Council. It recognizes the primacy of national responsibility and efforts aimed at realizing human rights. The promotion and protection of human rights should be addressed in a fair and equal manner, with, as the guiding principles, objectivity, respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, non-selectivity and transparency. In conclusion, we firmly believe that all State parties must make every effort to fulfil their treaty obligations. The approach of the Human Rights Council, treaty bodies, special procedures and OHCHR should not be confrontational; rather, it should focus on achieving the desired results through dialogue and capacity-building. \",\n\"{'Action': 2.734365800449723e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.890163936479894e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 2.814828405917069e-07, 'Body': 9.643075227216968e-10, 'Clarification': 4.912999784778549e-08, 'Conclusion': 1.838730945280531e-08, 'Election': 1.2371296520541364e-07, 'General': 0.9999946355819702, 'Introduction': 2.3670577320444863e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 7.752217534573447e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 4.7520074986096006e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 1.3161837841835222e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 2.164396619264153e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 2.5541549319996193e-08, 'OralStatement': 2.6456723034584684e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.9581477772590006e-08, 'RVRequested': 2.116252284523057e-09, 'RVTaken': 2.5605675357809332e-09, 'Session': 1.158611873108839e-08, 'Sponsorship': 4.358796878989324e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.8490883491040222e-08, 'Vote': 2.583744951323297e-08, 'VotingIntention': 1.8231739318252949e-07}\",\n[[\"Lal\", \"PERSON\"], [\"India\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Maza Martelli\", \"PERSON\"], [\"past two\", \"PARA\"], [\"the past decade\", \"DATE\"], [\"This year\", \"DATE\"], [\"India\", \"UNPE\"], [\"third\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"fewer than 10 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"India\", \"UNPE\"], [\"India\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 295,\n            'f': \"295\",\n        },\n\"A_72_PV-40-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 24,\n            'f': \"24\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999974966049194,\n            'f': \"0.9999974966049194\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Alsabah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): First of all, I would like to welcome His Excellency Mr. Maza Martelli, President of the Human Rights Council, who is with us in this Hall today. I also welcome the efforts that have been made during his presidency and thank him for the comprehensive report (A/72/53) he presented at the start of today\\u2019s meeting. My delegation familiarized itself with the report and its addendum, as well as the ideas they contain, which cover the special session of the Human Rights Council and the thirty-fourth, thirty-fifth and thirty- sixth ordinary sessions of the Council, as well as resolutions, decisions and President\\u2019s statements that are relevant to the discussion. Kuwait is mindful of the challenges that are being encountered by the United Nations and its bodies, in particular the Human Rights Council and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in the area of promoting and protecting human rights. These bodies are working so that all peoples of the world may enjoy human rights pursuant to, first, the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, in particular, paragraph 3 of Article 1 thereof, which sets forth as one of the main purposes of the United Nations to \\u201cpromot[e] and encourag[e] respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion\\u201d; secondly, States\\u2019 commitments under international law; and, thirdly, the aspirations of States to create a world where development is sustainable and countries are secure, safe and stable. In discussing the importance of enhancing cooperation among the States Members of the United Nations and the Organization itself, including the relevant United Nations human rights bodies, we would like to review cooperation between Kuwait and those United Nations bodies. We note the successful visit in February of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Zeid Ra\\u2019ad Al Hussein. He was made aware of national measures that we have taken in favour of human rights. In particular, he noted the human rights law that we adopted on the rights of families and minors, as well as other human rights legislation. Kuwait has also hosted Special Rapporteurs within the context of special procedures and mandates. In December 2016 and September 2017, we hosted the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children. The Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law also visited. We are hoping to host visits from the Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities and the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context. We hope to receive greater cooperation from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and its staff. We hope that the international community will provide greater assistance and support to the High Commissioner in this regard, so that our human rights situation may be strengthened and become more universally acceptable. It is unfortunate to see ongoing flagrant violations of human rights in various parts of the world. It is a complex challenge that the international community must address with wisdom and care. We deeply regret the many challenges in our region resulting from numerous conflicts that are affecting our brotherly peoples, who have been scattered and weakened. We firmly believe that the ongoing occupation of Palestinian territories by Israel is a flagrant violation of the human rights of the unarmed Palestinian people and contravenes international law and international humanitarian law, as well as all relevant Security Council resolutions. We also express our regret and concern with respect to the violations of the rights of the Rohingya population in Myanmar, especially their right to life. Finally, my delegation would like to reaffirm the importance of strengthening and protecting respect for human rights. Peace is a human right in itself. Since human rights are always evolving, we should strive to do more to guarantee that they are complied with and that people have access to them. Rules and rights, at both the national and international levels, need to adapt to and remain consistent with a world in constant change. \",\n\"{'Action': 5.804456648661471e-08, 'ActionObject': 2.287807454592894e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 6.266677132771292e-08, 'Body': 7.237215826627619e-10, 'Clarification': 7.460424455985049e-08, 'Conclusion': 1.3091046469071443e-08, 'Election': 5.2518075221996696e-08, 'General': 0.9999974966049194, 'Introduction': 1.434152181900572e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.0830814467510663e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 4.2027483715401104e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 4.588785795789363e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 3.008134115134453e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 2.7387423884306372e-08, 'OralStatement': 2.5923464264110407e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.7441387828730512e-08, 'RVRequested': 7.60291718471251e-10, 'RVTaken': 2.3641506530225342e-09, 'Session': 7.88380294380886e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.0708451014806997e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.552890698837018e-08, 'Vote': 3.980319362995033e-08, 'VotingIntention': 3.343370735819917e-07}\",\n[[\"Alsabah\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Maza Martelli\", \"PERSON\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"A/72/53\", \"Symbol\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"sixth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"resolutions,\", \"R\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"paragraph 3\", \"PARA\"], [\"secondly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"thirdly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"February\", \"DATE\"], [\"Zeid\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Al Hussein\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"December 2016 and September 2017\", \"DATE\"], [\"Israel\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Rohingya\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Myanmar\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 296,\n            'f': \"296\",\n        },\n\"A_72_PV-40-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 25,\n            'f': \"25\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999997615814209,\n            'f': \"0.9999997615814209\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Shilo (Israel): Human rights are not reserved for a select few. Human rights belong to all humans because they are human. Next year, we will mark the seventieth year since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which means that it has been 70 years since the world was offered a chance for a brighter future, based on universally recognized rights. Next year also marks the seventieth anniversary of the establishment of the State of Israel. In 1948, Israel committed itself to promoting, protecting and respecting human rights for all. It is a commitment that remains central to Israel\\u2019s democracy today. Our Declaration of Independence makes the following pledge. Israel will \\u201cfoster the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants ... irrespective of religion, race and sex\\u201d. Israel is committed to achieving gender equality and empowering women. Substantial Government legislation aims to reach those goals by facilitating mobility for women in the workplace, helping more women in Israel become chief executive officers, diplomats, high-ranking military leaders and Nobel Prize laureates. We are also working hard to make a difference on a global scale. Earlier this year, Israel introduced the first-ever United Nations resolution adopted by consensus on the prevention and elimination of sexual harassment in the workplace. Furthermore, civil society plays an essential role in Israel, where its vibrant involvement is a cornerstone of our nation\\u2019s culture. I would be remiss if I did not address the dismal and hypocritical situation of the Human Rights Council. Baseless accusations and dozens of biased resolutions of the Council under agenda item 7 have become part of a global campaign to delegitimize and demonize the State of Israel. This must change if we truly want to promote and protect human rights. The High Commissioner himself referred in early September to the hypocrisy that exists in the work of the Human Rights Council, when he said that \\u201cselectivity becomes a poison that eats away at the credibility of this body\\u201d. Israel has reiterated that fact time and time again. However, agenda item 7 remains and, with it, the singling out of one State \\u2014 the State of Israel. And while this happens, the world\\u2019s worst human rights violators avoid scrutiny. Some of them are even members of the Council and are therefore entrusted with the protection of human rights for the entire world. Israel has called, still calls and will continue to call for reform of the Human Rights Council that finally erases the discriminatory practices targeting our country. When Mr. Elie Wiesel accepted his Nobel Peace Prize, he noted that human rights were being violated on every continent and that there were more oppressed people in the world than there were free people. He simply asked how one could not be sensitive to their plight. We must ask ourselves a similar question. What are we doing to promote, protect and respect the human rights of all people? It will take our combined efforts to fulfil the noble aspirations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The struggle for human rights is an ongoing battle, and it is a battle that we must win. \",\n\"{'Action': 7.144997926644692e-09, 'ActionObject': 1.1469638572236818e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 1.19113572338847e-08, 'Body': 3.081527047421595e-11, 'Clarification': 5.8885807341368945e-09, 'Conclusion': 5.594079088844239e-10, 'Election': 3.7745561343172085e-08, 'General': 0.9999997615814209, 'Introduction': 2.162211529821434e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.4158682004605794e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 4.19569934351216e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 7.009992031292711e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 2.0543211576296017e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 4.851655077686701e-09, 'OralStatement': 5.324709007048511e-10, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.534454062759096e-09, 'RVRequested': 8.26258991781792e-11, 'RVTaken': 1.1375601155494408e-10, 'Session': 1.2065188847998343e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.9820205199305718e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.1643148667417336e-09, 'Vote': 1.5221788274288883e-08, 'VotingIntention': 1.0859219301551093e-08}\",\n[[\"Shilo\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Israel\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Next year\", \"DATE\"], [\"the seventieth year\", \"DATE\"], [\"70 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Next year\", \"DATE\"], [\"the State of Israel\", \"UNPE\"], [\"1948\", \"DATE\"], [\"Israel\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Israel\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Israel\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Israel\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Israel\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Earlier this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Israel\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Israel\", \"UNPE\"], [\"dozens\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"agenda item 7\", \"AI\"], [\"the State of Israel\", \"UNPE\"], [\"early September\", \"DATE\"], [\"\\u201cselectivity becomes a poison that eats away at the credibility of this body\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"Israel\", \"UNPE\"], [\"agenda item 7\", \"AI\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the State of Israel\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Israel\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Elie Wiesel\", \"PERSON\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 297,\n            'f': \"297\",\n        },\n\"A_72_PV-40-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 26,\n            'f': \"26\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999973773956299,\n            'f': \"0.9999973773956299\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Velichko (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): As a founding State Member of the United Nations, Belarus has always been and will remain an ethical and responsible participant in discharging its international commitments, including in the field of human rights. The establishment of the Human Rights Council is an important historical chapter in the work of the United Nations. The Council has been in existence for 11 years, which is enough time to allow us to draw conclusions about the work it has accomplished. Undoubtedly, a significant achievement of the Council is the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), which plays the role of an impartial monitoring mechanism on the human rights situation in all countries, without exception. It is through the UPR that we designed the dialogue with States. At the same time, the Human Rights Council has been unable to rid itself of the flaws of the Commission on Human Rights, which it replaced. Unfortunately, the Human Rights Council has been constantly burdening its agenda with confrontational decisions related to politicized approaches to human rights. An example of this would be, most of all, the country-specific resolutions, whose selectivity and political motives destroy the basic principles under which the Human Rights Council and the entire United Nations should be operating. We cannot help but be concerned at the fact that Member States do not seek to negotiate or reach consensus when making decisions in the Human Rights Council. As a result, a significant number of Council resolutions are adopted by vote, and many of the decisions represent a false consensus, since States subsequently dissociate themselves from adopted decisions. These decisions then cause disputes among Member States in the General Assembly. For some reason, it seems better to allocate considerable resources from the United Nations regular budget, which is derived from mandatory contributions from all States Members of the United Nations, to the implementation of non-consensual decisions than to support decisions aimed at addressing the real needs of States, which calls into question the legitimacy of the financing for these decisions. We should take note of one more alarming trend that is increasing the costs of the Council\\u2019s activities. This year\\u2019s report of the Council to the General Assembly (A/72/53) demonstrates an ongoing trend towards increasing its workload in relation to the implementation of resolutions and decisions adopted by the Council. We consider it unacceptable to expand the agenda of the Human Rights Council. In this context, we have seen some inappropriate ideas emerging on extending the duration of the Council\\u2019s sessions. We suggest, in contrast, that the Council take a serious look at this approach to the work and refrain from duplicating the decisions of the General Assembly and promoting divisive resolutions. We would like to emphasize that until States stop manipulating human rights for their political and narrow national interests, the Human Rights Council will not be able to have a constructive impact on real human rights situations on the ground. Instead of pursuing ineffective and costly country-specific procedures and commissions of inquiry, the Human Rights Council should encourage the cooperation of States with all relevant United Nations bodies in the field of human rights. An increasing number of States are following the example of Belarus by adopting comprehensive plans aimed at implementing the recommendations of the UPR of the Human Rights Council. Such practices should be adhered to and encouraged in all countries, without exception, regardless of their level of development or human rights situation. \",\n\"{'Action': 4.164954248153663e-08, 'ActionObject': 4.05939637460051e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 2.3003180160685588e-07, 'Body': 1.1693909174326222e-09, 'Clarification': 6.518909856367827e-08, 'Conclusion': 1.0776823877733932e-08, 'Election': 1.1231273333578429e-07, 'General': 0.9999973773956299, 'Introduction': 4.303859384435782e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.0809268147227158e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 3.905454803998509e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 9.865067873704447e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 1.3282991631058394e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 3.059678377326236e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.5423677268699976e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.1303712632582119e-08, 'RVRequested': 8.996369760261302e-10, 'RVTaken': 2.6472632974616772e-09, 'Session': 9.18294951191001e-09, 'Sponsorship': 8.072592372343479e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.9903900749795866e-08, 'Vote': 1.0135096317753778e-08, 'VotingIntention': 1.6270092828563065e-07}\",\n[[\"Velichko\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Belarus\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Belarus\", \"UNPE\"], [\"11 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolutions,\", \"R\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"A/72/53\", \"Symbol\"], [\"Belarus\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 298,\n            'f': \"298\",\n        },\n\"A_72_PV-40-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 27,\n            'f': \"27\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999943971633911,\n            'f': \"0.9999943971633911\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Sukhee (Mongolia): At the outset, I would like to express our sincere appreciation to the President of the Human Rights Council for his leadership and for presenting the report of the Council (A/72/53) today. Mongolia commends the outcomes of the Council\\u2019s work in the areas of the human rights of women, children and persons with disabilities, the abolition of the death penalty, trafficking in humans, racial discrimination, freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and association, and human rights defenders, all of which reflect the priorities set out in our voluntary pledges. During the reporting period, the Human Rights Council has made important strides, including in the creation of the mandates of the Special Rapporteur on the right to development. Human rights are vital for ensuring peace and security. In this regard, the role of the Council is particularly critical in conflict-affected areas where situations of human rights and freedoms have deteriorated and where there have been serious violations of the norms of international human rights law. As Mongolia is currently serving the second year of its membership of the Council, it is committed to continuing to contribute to the full implementation of its mandate. One of the major achievements of the Human Rights Council is indisputably the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), which is an effective mechanism for assessing the human rights situations of all States Members of the United Nations. We commend the successful conclusion of the second cycle of the UPR. With respect to its third cycle, we align ourselves with many other Member States in the belief that it should focus more on implementing the recommendations of the previous cycles. Accordingly, technical assistance and capacity-building are vital. We also consider the special-procedures mandate- holders as an integral part of the Human Rights Council and fully acknowledge their contribution to the effective promotion and protection of the human rights of all persons. In September 2017, the Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment, dedicated to monitoring compliance with obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, visited Mongolia, as did the United Nations Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. In our view, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights needs greater financial and human resources so as to be able to respond to and address human rights violations and facilitate capacity-building for Member States. There should also be more resources available for the effective implementation of the relevant recommendations. We believe that the Council needs to step up its action on the correlation between business and human rights, although this issue has only recently come to the fore of the global human rights agenda. The Human Rights Council should give greater attention to the situations where human rights are seriously jeopardized within or by private business entities. In this sense, Member States should constructively enhance their partnership and engagement with the private sector. As for the Government of Mongolia, we have shown our commitment by inviting a member of the Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises to visit our country in 2012. We would also take this opportunity to commend the initiative of and work undertaken by the President of the Council to move the discussion with Council members forward with an view to improving the Council\\u2019s working methods and enhancing its overall efficiency. Indeed, we believe that the Council\\u2019s efficiency could be further improved. Mongolia stands ready to offer its support for initiatives aimed at improving the working methods of the Council in a manner that is beneficial to all States and other stakeholders. \",\n\"{'Action': 4.188227364920749e-08, 'ActionObject': 2.0658227128933504e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 3.369357841620513e-07, 'Body': 1.6168557603890577e-09, 'Clarification': 9.652119103975565e-08, 'Conclusion': 3.6053439345096194e-08, 'Election': 6.608905067650994e-08, 'General': 0.9999943971633911, 'Introduction': 1.6129773712236783e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.137884986235349e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 9.342654294641761e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 1.51287924410326e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 2.505624479454127e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 3.918612634379315e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.502180992929425e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.5105590495400065e-08, 'RVRequested': 1.6970572724872568e-09, 'RVTaken': 5.840517847133242e-09, 'Session': 1.2348420064256516e-08, 'Sponsorship': 1.1236204855435972e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.4020313677274316e-08, 'Vote': 2.0015042068166622e-08, 'VotingIntention': 6.002475174682331e-07}\",\n[[\"Sukhee\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"A/72/53\", \"Symbol\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the second year\", \"DATE\"], [\"One\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"second\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"third\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"September 2017\", \"DATE\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2012\", \"DATE\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 299,\n            'f': \"299\",\n        },\n\"A_72_PV-40-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 28,\n            'f': \"28\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999973773956299,\n            'f': \"0.9999973773956299\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Hassani Nejad Pirkouhi (Islamic Republic of Iran): The Islamic Republic of Iran has taken note of the report of the Human Rights Council (A/72/53), and the statement made by Mr. Maza Martelli, President of the Human Rights Council, for which we thank him. Iran reaffirms its support for the work of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and his Office in fulfilling the mandate set forth in resolution 48/141. Iran also wishes to reiterate its firm commitment to an open, inclusive and constructive dialogue among Member States on all human rights issues in the framework of the Human Rights Council and its founding resolution 60/251. Unfortunately, the Council has yet to be fully utilized as a medium for dialogue and cooperation. Rather, in many instances, the Council has been exploited for mere political purposes through the use of confrontational and selective approaches. Politicization and manipulation have increased mistrust and eroded the effectiveness of the Council and its Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism. The rationale behind the UPR mechanism was to ensure universality, objectivity, non-selectivity and impartiality in the work of the Council. It is therefore unfortunate that a few countries still prefer to revert to the dysfunctional practice of the Commission on Human Rights and table country-specific resolutions that have no value and encourage confrontation rather than cooperation in the Council. Accordingly, it should not come as a surprise that the Council is finding itself on the same path that led to the demise of the Commission on Human Rights. The report of the Council includes, as a product of the unconstructive attempts of a few countries, a reference to a resolution that was adopted against my country. Bearing in mind all the facts on the ground, as well as the continuous cooperation of my country with various human rights mechanisms, in particular the UPR, the resolution, its ensuing reports and the appointment of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran are definitely misplaced, unwarranted and objectionable. The resolution is one of those instances that exposes the shortcomings of the Council and is nothing but a waste of limited resources that otherwise could be utilized for the meaningful promotion and protection of human rights. Accordingly, the Islamic Republic of Iran dissociates itself from the part of the Human Rights Council\\u2019s report that includes the so-called resolution on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. In the meantime, we also reiterate our principled position of non-recognition of and non-cooperation with the mandates that are created by the Council outside of the sphere of internationally recognized human rights. In conclusion, the Islamic Republic of Iran would like to underscore the important role of the Human Rights Council in confronting and addressing vicious waves of racism, bigotry, violent extremism and terrorism. The Human Rights Council has a role to play in raising global awareness of the imminent threat of terrorism and the mindsets behind it. The world should be warned of the speedy mobility of the evil forces of violent extremism and terrorism, and, more importantly, supporters of these menaces, including the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, should be cautioned that the boomerang they have thrown at others will sooner or later hit them when it returns. \",\n\"{'Action': 2.847080615708819e-08, 'ActionObject': 6.228896953786034e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 5.6944681858794866e-08, 'Body': 6.261126062057087e-10, 'Clarification': 4.0390922606547974e-08, 'Conclusion': 1.1171061409243066e-08, 'Election': 6.802879681799823e-08, 'General': 0.9999973773956299, 'Introduction': 9.051469760379405e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.1761423834855123e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 6.075446634667969e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 6.933413398968469e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 9.312113320447679e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 1.7072901314918454e-08, 'OralStatement': 2.7081464182288073e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.1485071560457527e-08, 'RVRequested': 6.168336952327991e-10, 'RVTaken': 2.4593169722919583e-09, 'Session': 1.0743964828918706e-08, 'Sponsorship': 1.6756448673049817e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.8856715300330507e-08, 'Vote': 7.442046978667349e-08, 'VotingIntention': 3.496948011161294e-07}\",\n[[\"Hassani Nejad\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Pirkouhi\", \"PERSON\"], [\"A/72/53\", \"Symbol\"], [\"Maza Martelli\", \"PERSON\"], [\"resolution 48/141\", \"R\"], [\"resolution 60/251\", \"R\"], [\"resolution,\", \"R\"], [\"the Islamic Republic of Iran\", \"UNPE\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the Islamic Republic of Iran\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the Islamic Republic of Iran\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the Islamic Republic of Iran\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Iraq\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 300,\n            'f': \"300\",\n        },\n\"A_72_PV-40-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 29,\n            'f': \"29\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999984502792358,\n            'f': \"0.9999984502792358\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Lukiantsev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation is of the view that the Human Rights Council should scrupulously follow the norms of international law and the principles of universality, impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity in its work so as to promote and defend human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction.

The Council is steadily evolving from an international platform for conducting mutually respectful dialogue on current human rights issues into an arena for some countries to settle their political scores. This alarming trend is expressed not only in increased attention to country-specific topics but in increasingly polarized discussions on agenda items that used to be carried out in a constructive and neutral manner. Even the thematic agenda items of the Council are increasingly being used by countries to make politically motivated demands of one another. The Russian position remains unchanged. There are no countries in the world free of human rights violations. In this regard, we believe that it is completely unacceptable for States to have policies that include mentoring, defaming or labelling, although many States do. They discredit the very idea of cooperation to promote and protect human rights and the work of United Nations human rights bodies. Nor is the Council\\u2019s effectiveness increased when the work of its special procedures regularly not only exceeds mandates and duplicates each other\\u2019s work but also suffers from a high degree of political bias, thus contradicting the code of conduct of the special procedures. Unfortunately, the seemingly most neutral agenda item of the Council \\u2014 agenda item 10, on technical assistance and capacity-building \\u2014 has not avoided politicization. The desire of some States with respect to that agenda item is to achieve their own short-term political objectives having to do, in particular, with defining the national legal status of territories. This undermines the major principles of technical assistance for the promotion and protection of human rights: non-confrontation and depoliticization. It inserts an added element of division into the work of the Council. In this context, we confirm our position that is unacceptable to use the United Nations human rights bodies to raise issues outside these bodies\\u2019 jurisdiction. We cannot agree with the approach of a number of countries linking the provision of technical assistance to States with the prevention of human rights violations. In our view, it is the practical assistance to States and helping them to build their institutional capacity- building for human rights that would be a major tool for prevention of these very violations. The initiatives of some States to attempt to give functions outside the Council to the Council to review principles and methods of work, establish new institutional formats and erode the intergovernmental nature of this body, have a destructive impact on the Council\\u2019s operations. The parameters of the work of the Council are set forth in resolution 60/251, and any changes to the work of the Council should be discussed in an intergovernmental format and adopted on the basis of a broad consensus. Dialogue in the Council will also be stunted if we impose aggressive standards characteristic of one group of countries on all others as if they represented a global standard, or if we enshrine narrow interpretations of international human rights norms as if they were universal norms. We are convinced that such gambits will only increase politicization and confrontation in the work of the Council and other United Nations human rights bodies. Past sessions have shown that the Council continues to intrude on the jurisdiction of other United Nations bodies. We call for maintaining the division of labour of the United Nations bodies and mechanisms, as set forth by the Charter. We are of the view that the integration of human rights issues into all spheres of the work of the United Nations must have its limits and should not lead to a duplication of the work of United Nations agencies and bodies. We are convinced that the major principle of the work of the Council and, in fact, of the entire United Nations human rights apparatus should be equal cooperation based on respect for sovereignty and the sovereign equality of States in strict compliance with procedural norms. We call on all countries to follow this principle and refrain from the use of double standards and their own narrow political concerns. Only then can we counteract further politicization and confrontation in the work of the Human Rights Council. \",\n\"{'Action': 4.178142987143474e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.953514683350477e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 1.309993393761033e-07, 'Body': 7.256685252698958e-10, 'Clarification': 5.254548085531496e-08, 'Conclusion': 8.30719670830149e-09, 'Election': 6.145474884533542e-08, 'General': 0.9999984502792358, 'Introduction': 1.754232386019794e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 6.086630754964517e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 3.362788447702769e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 5.575071959640354e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 7.841108526918106e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 2.1769057667597735e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.6189623863738234e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 9.573769332860138e-09, 'RVRequested': 4.055094038335483e-10, 'RVTaken': 2.183666802935136e-09, 'Session': 9.289611746510218e-09, 'Sponsorship': 6.790088935559879e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 8.522643035746569e-09, 'Vote': 6.543167341277467e-09, 'VotingIntention': 1.3873362547656143e-07}\",\n[[\"Lukiantsev\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Russian Federation\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Russian Federation\", \"UNPE\"], [\"agenda item 10\", \"AI\"], [\"resolution 60/251\", \"R\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Charter\", \"PERSON\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 301,\n            'f': \"301\",\n        },\n\"A_72_PV-40-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 30,\n            'f': \"30\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.999985933303833,\n            'f': \"0.999985933303833\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mrs. Martinic (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): Argentina wishes to warmly thank His Excellency Mr. Maza Martelli, President of the Human Rights Council, for being with us today in the General Assembly and welcomes his report (A/72/53) on the activities of the Council over the past year. First of all, Argentina believes that seamless coordination between New York and Geneva is relevant for the human rights agenda, which is why we welcome the opportunity to address the recent work of the Human Rights Council in the General Assembly. Argentina has always been, and will continue to be, a strong advocate for the independence, work and achievements of the Human Rights Council in the promotion, respect and protection of human rights. We firmly believe that the Council should stand on an equal footing with the main organs of the United Nations. Argentina wishes to take this opportunity to emphasize the role of the Human Rights Council in raising the profile of human rights throughout the world. The creation of the Council has made it possible to increase dialogue and the different channels of cooperation among States in the promotion of universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all persons, with their consequent contributions to development and international peace and security. In addition, Argentina is pleased with the recent renewal of the mandate of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances through Council resolution 36/6, of 28 September 2017. In this regard, Argentina calls on all States to strengthen cooperation with the special procedures and treaty bodies of the Council, answering all requests, presenting outstanding reports and ensuring that standing invitations are issued. In that regard, in the past year Argentina hosted the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, the Independent Expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. Next year, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment will visit Argentina. Without respect for the existing institutions and mandates of United Nations organs, it will be extremely hard to meet the expectations of our peoples in terms of ensuring the defence and protection of human rights. Therefore, all Member States must undertake to respect the independence and integrity of the mandate of the Human Rights Council, in accordance with resolution 60/251 and other relevant resolutions. Finally, Argentina would like to welcome the newly elected countries to the Council, and we reiterate our unwavering commitment to defending the independence and work of the Human Rights Council. \",\n\"{'Action': 3.5352968552615494e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.420903039672794e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 2.01957675471931e-07, 'Body': 1.5350319904072762e-09, 'Clarification': 7.107632171710065e-08, 'Conclusion': 5.4761809309411547e-08, 'Election': 7.656156242319412e-08, 'General': 0.999985933303833, 'Introduction': 9.61335354077164e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.0131984140571149e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 1.026443285923051e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 1.5115743323690367e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 2.9228954190330114e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 3.067427201131068e-08, 'OralStatement': 2.451300673556034e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.545845927988012e-08, 'RVRequested': 3.414247773392276e-09, 'RVTaken': 5.677395886749537e-09, 'Session': 1.4488255040134845e-08, 'Sponsorship': 1.4386479563199828e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 5.8375423606094046e-08, 'Vote': 7.960808545703912e-08, 'VotingIntention': 7.118367761904665e-07}\",\n[[\"Martinic\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Argentina\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Argentina\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Maza Martelli\", \"PERSON\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"A/72/53\", \"Symbol\"], [\"the past year\", \"DATE\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Argentina\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Argentina\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Argentina\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Argentina\", \"UNPE\"], [\"resolution 36/6\", \"R\"], [\"28 September 2017\", \"DATE\"], [\"Argentina\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the past year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Argentina\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Next year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Argentina\", \"UNPE\"], [\"resolution 60/251\", \"R\"], [\"Argentina\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 302,\n            'f': \"302\",\n        },\n\"A_72_PV-40-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 31,\n            'f': \"31\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999994039535522,\n            'f': \"0.9999994039535522\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Escalante Hasb\\u00fan (El Salvador) (spoke in Spanish): We welcome the presence today of Ambassador Joaqu\\u00edn Maza Martelli, President of the Human Rights Council \\u2014 a proud Salvadoran and a personal mentor of mine \\u2014 and thank him for his briefing. We commend him on his hard work this year at the helm of such an important intergovernmental forum. We welcome the report (A/72/53), which we trust will be adopted in its entirety in due course by the General Assembly. The Human Rights Council, which is a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly, is the principal intergovernmental body of the United Nations responsible for ensuring human rights, with its own jurisdiction over debates on all thematic issues related to human rights. In this regard, we wish to reiterate that in both this plenary and the Third Committee, the procedures, mechanisms, structures and competencies that form the basis of the Human Rights Council\\u2019s work must be respected, given that they have all been authorized by the General Assembly. Its primordial task is reflected not just in the diversity of the Council\\u2019s agenda, but also in its resolutions, the full participation of Member States in the Universal Periodic Review and the broad participation and involvement of civil society in all discussions in Geneva. For El Salvador, as an active member of the Human Rights Council since 2015, when we began our first term as a member of the Council, the respect and promotion of human rights is a State policy and a fundamental pillar of Salvadoran foreign policy. In recent years, we have made major progress in this field with processes that promote respect for the human person as such. Similarly, we have become engaged in international processes whereby we have become aware of the importance of organizing and promoting the full enjoyment of rights. My delegation has addressed these issues and detailed some of our experiences within each of the substantive agenda items, both in the Third Committee in New York and in Council sessions in Geneva, where we have participated in our national capacity. We therefore wish to reaffirm that El Salvador is committed to promoting and protecting human rights for everyone without discriminating against anyone. We commend the President of the Human Rights Council for the work done by the Council this year and once again welcome him in New York on this auspicious occasion. \",\n\"{'Action': 4.886246074420342e-09, 'ActionObject': 2.788558051136647e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 4.727846558694182e-08, 'Body': 1.1623657591997016e-10, 'Clarification': 2.9096264952954698e-08, 'Conclusion': 7.817036795643162e-09, 'Election': 6.7128702596619405e-09, 'General': 0.9999994039535522, 'Introduction': 3.2550445894230506e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.081577799017964e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 1.4340372445076355e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 1.3381562524727997e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 6.251813289281927e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 6.982583844461487e-09, 'OralStatement': 1.541026151130609e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 6.207703684424359e-09, 'RVRequested': 1.651109804434725e-10, 'RVTaken': 5.066017050303628e-10, 'Session': 1.5090243499216172e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.5959036314683317e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.0835867192990918e-09, 'Vote': 6.136282593161013e-09, 'VotingIntention': 1.084202381207433e-07}\",\n[[\"Escalante Hasb\\u00fan\", \"PERSON\"], [\"El Salvador\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Joaqu\\u00edn Maza Martelli\", \"PERSON\"], [\"this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"A/72/53\", \"Symbol\"], [\"Third Committee\", \"C\"], [\"resolutions,\", \"R\"], [\"El Salvador\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2015\", \"DATE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"recent years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Third Committee\", \"C\"], [\"El Salvador\", \"UNPE\"], [\"this year\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 303,\n            'f': \"303\",\n        },\n\"A_72_PV-40-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 32,\n            'f': \"32\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999984502792358,\n            'f': \"0.9999984502792358\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Mohamed (Maldives): I would like to begin by thanking His Excellency Mr. Joaqu\\u00edn Alexander Maza Martelli of El Salvador, President of the Human Rights Council during its eleventh cycle, for the exemplary manner in which he and his Bureau have steered the work of the Council this year. I also express my appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Zeid Ra\\u2019ad Al Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and his Office, for their continued efforts to constructively engage with all nations in the promotion and protection of human rights across the globe. The Human Rights Council is the institutional expression of the international community\\u2019s commitment to promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. When establishing the Council in 2006, the General Assembly made it extremely clear, in resolution 60/251, that the Council\\u2019s work should be \\u201cguided by the principles of universality, objectivity and non-selectivity\\u201d. The Assembly also mandated the Council to provide advisory services, technical assistance and capacity-building to States \\u201cin consultation with and with the consent of Member States concerned\\u201d. Eleven years later, there is a profound need for the Council to return to its roots and undertake its work in an impartial, objective and non-selective manner, reflect its intergovernmental character and ensure its credibility. It is that credibility that will enable the Council to inspire international actions in support of protecting the human rights of millions of Syrians who have been besieged, displaced and deprived of their basic right to life and liberty. My delegation condemns not only the gross human rights abuses in Syria, but the international community\\u2019s acceptance of them. We seem to remain complacent when warring parties attack humanitarian targets, including hospitals, schools, utilities and aid workers; where the use of chemical weapons is now well documented; where terrorists target minorities and the most vulnerable segments of a population; and when all this happens with complete impunity. The Human Rights Council can also inspire international actions to stop the deteriorating human rights and humanitarian crisis in the State of Palestine. That crisis emerged solely as a result of the illegal and prolonged occupation by Israel, which, as of next year, will mark its seventieth anniversary and which has denied generations of Palestinians many of their fundamental rights. Another human rights and humanitarian crisis that has not received an adequate response from the Council is the situation facing the Rohingya community in Myanmar. The minority Muslim population is facing gross and systematic violations of its rights, in which gang rape, mass killings and the burning of homes, schools, markets, shops and mosques has become commonplace. The renewal of the fact-finding mission on Myanmar by the Council is a step in the right direction, but that is not enough. The Maldives supports the call for the urgent convening of a special session of the Human Rights Council with the aim of adopting a substantive and clear outcome resolution on ending any further atrocities. The Human Rights Council will enjoy a greater level of support and cooperation from the broader United Nations membership when the Council is seen to be more inclusive in its working methods and when the universality principle is applied in good faith. The working methods of the Council today are more opaque and less inclusive than those of the General Assembly. As a result, representatives who attend only a single session find themselves at a severe disadvantage, as is the case with many representatives from small island developing States. For instance, inadequate time is provided for informal consultations on most resolutions, and input by non-member States at informal negotiations is often ignored, partially owing to the disproportionate deference afforded States members of the Council. The Maldives has called for the introduction of specific practical measures to improve the working methods of the Council, including ensuring that draft resolutions are circulated before sessions begin and that the compilation and circulation of all comments made in informal consultations is done in a timely manner, as well as ensuring that every State has the opportunity to comment on the potential effects of any draft resolution prior to its adoption. The Maldives has had the privilege of serving on the Human Rights Council for two consecutive terms. We are proud of the contributions that we have made to the Council\\u2019s work and the outcomes that we have facilitated. The Maldives introduced the idea of examining the human rights dimensions of climate change and led the Council\\u2019s efforts that resulted in the establishment of a mandate on human rights and the environment. The Maldives also had the privilege to introduce, with the support of core groups, draft resolutions on parliaments as promoters of human rights, on the independence of the judiciary, on child and forced marriages, on the freedom of assembly and association, and on prevention, as well as on the establishment of and support for the Voluntary Technical Assistance Trust Fund to Support the Participation of Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States in the work of the Human Rights Council. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on international justice is also an initiative that we supported. The Maldives is also pleased to be coordinating the work of the Asia-Pacific Group in the Council in 2017. The Maldives remains committed to strengthening the Council, its working methods and its ability to work with the Governments of Member States in responding to and promoting human rights around the world.

Georgia reaffirms its full support for the Human Rights Council and its mechanisms as important instruments in efforts to promote universal respect for the protection of all human rights. During the past decade, the Human Rights Council has become the main body for mobilizing the international community to address and respond to gross human rights violations and abuses worldwide. We also welcomed the high-level event on Human Rights Council reform, which was held at the current session of the General Assembly in September. Considering the critical humanitarian situation in many parts of the world, we deem it important to seek opportunities to reinforce the effectiveness of the Council based upon lessons learned. In our view, the effective work of the Council strongly depends on universal participation. The voice of each State Member of the United Nations, irrespective of its size, population or strength, must be heard. With that in mind, Georgia has become the first Eastern European State to contribute to the Voluntary Technical Assistance Trust Fund to Support the Participation of Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States in the work of the Human Rights Council, which supports the participation of small-country delegations in the Council\\u2019s work. Georgia would like to express its sincere gratitude to the past and current Bureaus of the Council for their efforts to improve the working methods of the Council and to manage its meetings. We believe, however, that additional measures need to be undertaken to that end, leading to further constructive engagement in that process. Over the years, the Human Rights Council has adopted a number of important thematic and country- specific resolutions. In that regard, let me underline the resolution on cooperation with Georgia, adopted during the thirty-fourth session of the Council, which calls for immediate access to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and international and regional human rights mechanisms for the occupied regions of Georgia. Pursuant to the resolution, the Council considered the issue of Georgia at its thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth sessions. Regrettably, no access had been granted at that time to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights or to other United Nations human rights mechanisms. However, the report presented by the High Commissioner during the thirty-sixth session of the Council reflected the serious human rights violations that have been occurring in the occupied territories. We underline the importance of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) as a key element of the Human Rights Council\\u2019s efforts to assess the human rights situation in every country. Georgia has incorporated the recommendations received during the UPR into its national action plans on human rights. It is of the utmost importance that all Member States engaged in the UPR process adhere to the accepted rules and regulations. Georgia attaches particular importance to the recommendations of the United Nations human rights system and supports steps towards enabling the mechanisms to monitor the level of the implementation of accepted UPR recommendations by Member States. At the national level, Georgia has established an institution that is mandated to track and coordinate national follow-up and implementation of the aforementioned obligations and recommendations. It is noteworthy that this year Georgia joined the Group of Friends on national implementation, reporting and follow-up within the Human Rights Council, which seeks to take the implementation agenda forward. In our view, effective domestic implementation is the key to advancing human rights on the ground. The implementation gap remains an important issue with regard to Human Rights Council resolutions, and more attention needs to be paid to implementation aspects by Member States. We highly value the effective participation of civil-society representatives in the work of the Human Rights Council. Further strengthening the role of non-governmental organizations is important for safeguarding the space allotted to civil society and ensuring that their voices are heard. In that context, Georgia strongly rejects any act of intimidation or reprisal directed against individuals and groups that cooperate or have cooperated with the United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms. In the area of human rights, it is our duty to prevent and ensure adequate protection against such acts. As we discuss the importance of human rights mechanisms, I would like to underline Georgia\\u2019s support for the special procedures, which represent another effective tool for addressing specific country and thematic situations. Georgia has extended a standing invitation to all special-procedures mandate-holders and has hosted several visits by United Nations Special Rapporteurs, including the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences. In conclusion, let me once again reiterate Georgia\\u2019s strong commitment to joining the international community in strengthening and promoting human rights throughout the world. \",\n\"{'Action': 9.566556968820805e-08, 'ActionObject': 4.552488164222268e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 3.0495294822685537e-07, 'Body': 3.035340867540981e-09, 'Clarification': 1.244862914973055e-07, 'Conclusion': 3.935554104828043e-08, 'Election': 1.6026211824282655e-07, 'General': 0.9999920129776001, 'Introduction': 2.6516170237300685e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.4978878581928257e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 1.0005188499917494e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 2.023988265875687e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 3.6821290905209025e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 5.2181203358259154e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.307056152199948e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.880751719975706e-08, 'RVRequested': 3.0811180273815353e-09, 'RVTaken': 8.8047542590175e-09, 'Session': 2.669723642156896e-08, 'Sponsorship': 2.1406462380468838e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 5.396920954581219e-08, 'Vote': 3.8214029274286077e-08, 'VotingIntention': 6.082263439566304e-07}\",\n[[\"Agladze\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Georgia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"A/72/53\", \"Symbol\"], [\"Georgia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the past decade\", \"DATE\"], [\"September\", \"DATE\"], [\"Georgia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Georgia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Bureaus\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Georgia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Georgia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"resolution,\", \"R\"], [\"Georgia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Georgia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Georgia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Georgia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Georgia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"resolutions,\", \"R\"], [\"Georgia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Georgia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Georgia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Georgia\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 305,\n            'f': \"305\",\n        },\n\"A_72_PV-40-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 34,\n            'f': \"34\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999988079071045,\n            'f': \"0.9999988079071045\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Valiente D\\u00edaz (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): The Human Rights Council was established as a result of the need to address the double standards, confrontation and political manipulation that characterized the now- defunct Commission on Human Rights. Those practices, which discredited the Commission \\u2014 and which we reject in the strongest terms \\u2014 must be avoided. We reiterate our concern about the tendency to impose selectivity and double standards in the Council when considering human rights situations, as reflected in the report of the Human Rights Council (A/72/53). Political manipulation must cease when the Council deals with country situations. Cooperation and respectful dialogue should guide the work of the Council. Cuba reaffirms that the Universal Periodic Review was established as the only universal mechanism for the comprehensive analysis of the human rights situations in all countries. It is the Council\\u2019s main distinctive element compared to the previous Commission on Human Rights. The mechanism has proven to be a means for international cooperation in the field of human rights, based on constructive dialogue and respect for the principles of universality, objectivity, impartiality and non-selectivity. Those principles must also be respected by the special procedures of the Human Rights Council and the human rights treaty bodies. The special-procedures mandate holders must also observe the code of conduct adopted during the institution-building process of the Human Rights Council. Cuba believes that as long as an unjust and exclusive international economic and political order persists, the Council must continue to speak out in favour of a democratic and equitable international order. For as long as unilateral coercive measures are imposed and blockades are maintained \\u2014 such as the one that Cuba has suffered for more than 55 years \\u2014 the Council must reject those practices and demand that they be ended. The Council must ensure that the claim to the right to international solidarity becomes an imperative if we wish to confront the serious challenges posed by the deep economic, financial, energy, environmental and food crises that affect the whole world today. We regret that, at the previous session of the Human Rights Council, resolutions that have enjoyed the consensus of the Member States for several years had to be adopted by vote, such as the right to food. At this session of the General Assembly, my delegation will again submit a draft resolution on that topic in the hope that such an important initiative will enjoy the constructive support of all delegations so that we can send a clear message of consensus on such a crucial issue. Cuba will continue to work on promoting the rights of peoples to self-determination, peace and development and the right to food, the establishment of a democratic and equitable international order, the fight against racism, xenophobia and all forms of discrimination, the realization of cultural rights and respect for diversity. Cuba affirms its firm commitment to promoting and respecting all human rights for everyone. \",\n\"{'Action': 2.3586284925158907e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.3920833374925223e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 3.478979238025204e-08, 'Body': 3.321612151996334e-10, 'Clarification': 3.480758081764179e-08, 'Conclusion': 4.292662669769243e-09, 'Election': 3.583995678013707e-08, 'General': 0.9999988079071045, 'Introduction': 7.115350513231533e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 5.175243789068418e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 1.8256407940953068e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 2.4816746435618597e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 1.9737372269901243e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 1.061623766673847e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.2486601086436622e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 9.068728878958154e-09, 'RVRequested': 3.2714631004182593e-10, 'RVTaken': 9.204316753219643e-10, 'Session': 3.3707188151765877e-09, 'Sponsorship': 4.481030657643714e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.2444139052547598e-08, 'Vote': 1.5049858248517012e-08, 'VotingIntention': 1.1323803050800052e-07}\",\n[[\"Valiente D\\u00edaz\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Cuba\", \"UNPE\"], [\"A/72/53\", \"Symbol\"], [\"Cuba\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Cuba\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Cuba\", \"UNPE\"], [\"more than 55 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"several years\", \"DATE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"Cuba\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Cuba\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 306,\n            'f': \"306\",\n        },\n\"A_72_PV-40-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 35,\n            'f': \"35\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999996423721313,\n            'f': \"0.9999996423721313\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Wagner (Switzerland) (spoke in French): Switzerland would like to thank the President of the Human Rights Council for his report (A/72/53). Switzerland is pleased that the opportunity was taken this year to formulate specific proposals for strengthening the impact and contribution of the Human Rights Council to the protection and promotion of the respect for human rights around the world. Those proposals have served as a basis for identifying priority courses of action that now need to be implemented so as to strengthen the human rights pillar at the United Nations as a whole. Switzerland will continue its engagement in that respect. First, Switzerland firmly believes that the international community\\u2019s success in protecting and promoting respect for human rights depends on the better integration of human rights into the United Nations global agenda. The relationship between human rights and peace and security is worthy of special attention, particularly in view of its potential for conflict prevention. It was with that in mind that Switzerland and other Member States launched an appeal on 13 June to put human rights at the heart of Member States\\u2019 efforts in conflict prevention and, in particular, to enhance the exchange of useful information between the Human Rights Council and the Security Council. Switzerland invites all Member States to join the 71 countries that have already offered their support to that appeal and to commit to putting it into action. Secondly, I wish to comment on the space granted to civil society, where we are seeing increasingly serious violations and abuses of the rights to the freedom of expression and the freedom of peaceful assembly and association. Civil society plays a fundamental role in United Nations mechanisms. The greater inclusion and protection of civil society therefore represents an investment in strengthening the impact, efficiency and credibility of the Human Rights Council. In that regard, Switzerland is concerned about numerous cases of intimidation and reprisals against human rights defenders and other members of civil society while they exercise their fundamental rights by providing first-hand information to representatives of United Nations mechanisms. Switzerland wishes to thank the President of the Human Rights Council for his commitment to follow up on such cases and urges the international community to reverse that negative trend and take further action to protect those defending human rights \\u2014 especially those who cooperate with the Council and its mechanisms. Switzerland feels that the increase in the Council\\u2019s workload confirms the relevance of its mandate, but does not believe that that workload is sustainable in the medium term. Further reflection is needed on optimizing working methods and implementing the relevant proposals already on the table. At the same time, we believe that it is essential to work on improving the atmosphere at the Human Rights Council and avoid a climate of confrontation. Switzerland calls on all Member States to work constructively on Council matters so as to enhance its credibility and efficiency. \",\n\"{'Action': 5.881754638892289e-09, 'ActionObject':

Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al Sabah and to the Government and the people of Kuwait. His Highness was a distinguished statesman, an outstanding humanitarian, a bridge-builder and a messenger of peace. We mourn his loss together with Kuwait. And it is fitting that we do so in the General Assembly. His Highness prioritized cooperation and multilateralism and led Kuwait to join the United Nations in 1963. He steered his country\\u2019s foreign policy for almost 60 years, first as Foreign Minister and then as ruler from 2006. Throughout his reign, His Highness earned recognition and respect from near and far for his outstanding leadership and commitment to peacemaking. He always stood ready to bridge faiths, cultures and countries in the neighbourhood and beyond. With foresight, political wisdom and persistence, His Highness shaped Kuwait\\u2019s preventive diplomatic engagement in the region and internationally. He played a vital role in mediating crises, facilitating dialogue and spreading messages of peace, tolerance and coexistence. As a close friend of the United Nations, he was also reliably on the front lines of mobilizing the international community in acts of solidarity. I will never forget when I was High Commissioner for Refugees at the peak of the Syrian refugee crisis. In the complex political situation at the time, it was very difficult to mobilize international solidarity to support Syria\\u2019s refugees. It was His Highness who decided to convene the first conference for solidarity with Syria. Kuwait started it with an offer that was so generous that other countries felt the need to do the same, and we were able to provide an effective response to the Syrian refugee crisis. Then, for two more years, when no other countries volunteered to do so, His Highness continued to convene conferences for humanitarian solidarity with the Syrian people and refugees and maintained a very high level of support and generous leadership. His initiative and leadership were decisive in some of the most important humanitarian efforts around the globe. The lives of millions of people in need were improved because of his compassion and commitment. His ambitious vision also contributed to the evolution of modern Kuwait. His work to support and empower women at all levels was manifested in his efforts to ensure women\\u2019s suffrage in Kuwait. The world has lost a global leader and a symbol of humanity. I extend my best wishes to Amir Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, who, while grieving the loss of his brother, has taken over the leadership of Kuwait. The United Nations looks forward to continuing its strong partnership and friendship with the State of Kuwait, while building on the legacy of His Highness. We will keep supporting Kuwait\\u2019s mediation efforts and its role in promoting peace and stability. I trust that the tireless efforts of His Highness in regional and international diplomacy and stability will remain a priority for the State of Kuwait. At this difficult time, I once again offer my deepest condolences on this heavy loss to the people of Kuwait, the region and far beyond. \",\n\"{'Action': 5.7011146914476285e-09, 'ActionObject': 9.993078586845172e-10, 'AgendaStatus': 1.1418534562324112e-08, 'Body': 5.661804358680911e-11, 'Clarification': 4.980583501179581e-09, 'Conclusion': 1.2293971396459824e-09, 'Election': 5.668621128052109e-08, 'General': 0.999998927116394, 'Introduction': 9.907256526275887e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.0292668939371197e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 4.503488693075042e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 8.876795964951611e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 3.2950005390830484e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 5.359308552499442e-09, 'OralStatement': 2.5983520890449086e-10, 'PresidingOfficer': 5.511236356170457e-09, 'RVRequested': 1.873919491801601e-10, 'RVTaken': 1.3345509419782076e-10, 'Session': 2.279416211337093e-09, 'Sponsorship': 2.3647753200073396e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.8749464203438038e-09, 'Vote': 3.240051071884409e-08, 'VotingIntention': 1.2293954299025245e-08}\",\n[[\"Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al Sabah\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"1963\", \"DATE\"], [\"almost 60 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"two more years\", \"DATE\"], [\"millions\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the State of Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the State of Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 340,\n            'f': \"340\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.16-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 30,\n            'f': \"30\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999632835388184,\n            'f': \"0.9999632835388184\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The President: I now give the floor to the representative of Cameroon, who will speak on behalf of the Group of African States.\",\n\"{'Action': 3.9928546580192403e-10, 'ActionObject': 9.132586353821637e-11, 'AgendaStatus': 7.21323161201326e-08, 'Body': 2.413376616605678e-11, 'Clarification': 3.5251740415631616e-10, 'Conclusion': 7.501958165789802e-09, 'Election': 5.911818146131509e-09, 'General': 3.544124047039077e-05, 'Introduction': 0.9999632835388184, 'MeetingDateTime': 4.7767404615095543e-11, 'MeetingLocation': 1.1741115857333284e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 1.7009342545559747e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 2.6021889087957106e-09, 'MeetingStatus': 4.202250103446659e-09, 'OralStatement': 4.657806648380612e-16, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.914410626748577e-07, 'RVRequested': 1.7032255072990665e-07, 'RVTaken': 1.2028387834372989e-11, 'Session': 2.8507994576099094e-11, 'Sponsorship': 7.374905807572274e-14, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.9457347377738188e-07, 'Vote': 4.1409091977584467e-07, 'VotingIntention': 2.131799181626093e-09}\",\n[[\"Cameroon\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 341,\n            'f': \"341\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.16-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 31,\n            'f': \"31\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999995231628418,\n            'f': \"0.9999995231628418\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon): On behalf of the Group of African States, it is with profound respect that I pay tribute to His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the Amir of the State of Kuwait, who passed away two weeks ago.

The leadership and vision of Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah at home led to key advances in many important areas. His efforts helped to ensure that his nation enjoyed strong international engagement and partnership. A couple of years ago, under the leadership of His Highness Sheikh Sabah, Kuwait donated hundreds of millions of dollars for humanitarian operations in many African countries as well as in the Middle East. Kuwait\\u2019s leadership and funding has saved lives and encouraged others to participate in coordinated humanitarian action. Under the Amir\\u2019s leadership, Kuwait also became an important contributor to humanitarian issues, helping to improve the lives of people across the globe. The Amir\\u2019s efforts to promote dialogue, harmony and peace will always be remembered. In conclusion, I would therefore like to extend my sincere condolences to his bereaved family and to the Government and the people of Kuwait. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.2427377349411017e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.0638151470843127e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 5.484908083275286e-09, 'Body': 4.071658635251829e-11, 'Clarification': 4.816304244315006e-09, 'Conclusion': 7.822790748512887e-10, 'Election': 1.3992246294947108e-07, 'General': 0.9999995231628418, 'Introduction': 2.43464938876059e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.1327753179912747e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 2.9063251805183654e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 4.361843941591559e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 6.79346401355474e-09, 'MeetingStatus': 7.151649494829826e-09, 'OralStatement': 2.715318248025511e-10, 'PresidingOfficer': 5.493199672912397e-09, 'RVRequested': 1.2194578680180257e-10, 'RVTaken': 1.4120618563318033e-10, 'Session': 4.039545586920212e-09, 'Sponsorship': 3.3367461571565116e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 9.912217713292648e-10, 'Vote': 6.313202050023392e-08, 'VotingIntention': 7.486406161660852e-09}\",\n[[\"Tommo Monthe\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Cameroon\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the State of Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"two weeks ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"the State of Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sabah Al-Ahmad\", \"PERSON\"], [\"A couple of years ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sabah\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 342,\n            'f': \"342\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.16-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 32,\n            'f': \"32\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999043941497803,\n            'f': \"0.9999043941497803\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The President: I now give the floor to the representative of Indonesia, who will speak on behalf of the Group of Asia-Pacific States.\",\n\"{'Action': 2.9743015161898256e-08, 'ActionObject': 8.379359428545285e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 5.317703539731156e-07, 'Body': 1.2924125103452866e-09, 'Clarification': 6.490003201520267e-09, 'Conclusion': 5.82322137177016e-08, 'Election': 2.6076028802890505e-07, 'General': 8.263781637651846e-05, 'Introduction': 0.9999043941497803, 'MeetingDateTime': 9.276250323431157e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 1.063089882791246e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 2.3630695178411543e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 4.6893646299395186e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 4.82683759628344e-08, 'OralStatement': 6.421390654452741e-14, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.3370406526955776e-06, 'RVRequested': 1.950496198332985e-06, 'RVTaken': 5.602119323988575e-10, 'Session': 1.0524870974748524e-09, 'Sponsorship': 7.827336001575702e-12, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 4.200293915346265e-06, 'Vote': 2.456373294990044e-06, 'VotingIntention': 1.9923547256439633e-08}\",\n[[\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 343,\n            'f': \"343\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.16-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 33,\n            'f': \"33\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.999974250793457,\n            'f': \"0.999974250793457\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Djani (Indonesia): On behalf of the Group of Asia-Pacific States, I express my deepest condolences to the family of the late Amir of Kuwait, His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, and to the Government and the people of the State of Kuwait.

At this time of national mourning in Kuwait, the Group of Eastern European States offers its sincere condolences to the ruling family, the Government and the people of Kuwait. His Highness ruled over Kuwait for 15 years and had overseen Kuwait\\u2019s foreign policy for almost 40 years. He was known as the wise man of the region, or the dean of Arab diplomacy, for his determination and his unreserved efforts to strengthen peace, cooperation, prosperity, both in the region and throughout the globe. The late Amir has left an impressive legacy. For more than five tumultuous decades, he maintained Kuwait\\u2019s strong commitment to international cooperation and especially to the United Nations. His determination was tested by wars, conflicts and a foreign occupation. In 1990, His Highness spearheaded the creation of the international coalition that recovered the freedom and sovereignty of Kuwait following its painful occupation by the forces of Saddam Hussein. That historic unified response by the United Nations community upheld the Charter of the United Nations and demonstrated clearly that no Member of the United Nations will be abandoned in the face of external military aggression. That telling lesson still resonates today. His Highness spared no effort in orchestrating reconciliation and reconstruction in the Gulf region and the Middle East. He was one of the architects of the Gulf Cooperation Council, enhancing regional cooperation. Kuwait has shown a strong commitment to enhancing the role of the United Nations, while playing an active part in the Security Council in 2018 and 2019. Kuwait has also generously hosted a number of donor conferences to alleviate humanitarian suffering and foster recovery in Syria and Iraq. His Highness was honoured with a United Nations Global Leadership Award in recognition of the significance of his contribution in that area. At the ceremony, then- Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said, \\u201cWe are sitting together with a great humanitarian leader of our world.... Kuwait may be a small country in size but it has a big, broad and compassionate heart.\\u201d His Highness was a strong voice in the region when promoting women\\u2019s rights and the freedom of the media, thereby paving the way for more democratic, inclusive and prosperous societies in the future. Last but not least, under the leadership of His Highness, Kuwait has played an active role in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and development cooperation around the world. Many world leaders have been paying their respects to the late Amir of Kuwait, including in Eastern Europe. Secretary-General Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres calls him an extraordinary symbol of wisdom and generosity, a messenger of peace and a bridge-builder. Those qualities will be greatly missed and admired by future leaders of the twenty-first century. Once again, the Group of Eastern European States offers its sincere condolences to the ruling family and to the Government and the people of Kuwait. \",\n\"{'Action': 6.792671314315157e-08, 'ActionObject': 3.899749412283882e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 1.615491100892541e-07, 'Body': 1.0625793578356024e-09, 'Clarification': 2.8043457334092636e-08, 'Conclusion': 1.7320692435873752e-08, 'Election': 5.894081027690845e-07, 'General': 0.9999891519546509, 'Introduction': 7.663391443202272e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 8.625871572576216e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 9.160225289406299e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 1.5945129661076862e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 1.6434911458418355e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 5.2408463346864664e-08, 'OralStatement': 2.905197638014556e-09, 'PresidingOfficer': 5.05164088338006e-08, 'RVRequested': 3.180624874588034e-09, 'RVTaken': 3.1542599643330504e-09, 'Session': 3.418398364374298e-08, 'Sponsorship': 2.588593117636151e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.367596690395658e-08, 'Vote': 3.163689541452186e-07, 'VotingIntention': 1.5638745765045314e-07}\",\n[[\"Pildegovi\\u010ds\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Latvia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"29 September\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the State of Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the age of 91\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"15 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"almost 40 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Amir\", \"PERSON\"], [\"more than five\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"1990\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Saddam Hussein\", \"PERSON\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2018\", \"DATE\"], [\"2019\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Iraq\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2030\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Amir\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the twenty-first century\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 346,\n            'f': \"346\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.16-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 36,\n            'f': \"36\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9971081614494324,\n            'f': \"0.9971081614494324\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The President: I now give the f loor to the representative of Uruguay, who will speak on behalf of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States.\",\n\"{'Action': 5.787995149830749e-08, 'ActionObject': 2.6617806625495177e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 5.280317964206915e-06, 'Body': 9.38808497608079e-09, 'Clarification': 3.9315239064308116e-08, 'Conclusion': 1.4868388689137646e-06, 'Election': 8.627003467154282e-07, 'General': 0.002854919759556651, 'Introduction': 0.9971081614494324, 'MeetingDateTime': 3.6843454953583432e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 1.11207057784668e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 3.3510168861994316e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 3.0734800020582043e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 2.021708098709496e-07, 'OralStatement': 4.05346155946118e-12, 'PresidingOfficer': 5.2379573389771394e-06, 'RVRequested': 8.187180355889723e-06, 'RVTaken': 8.284482433396079e-09, 'Session': 1.4737929987518328e-08, 'Sponsorship': 1.9156934372155376e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 5.6263929764099885e-06, 'Vote': 6.558576842508046e-06, 'VotingIntention': 2.8710272204079956e-07}\",\n[[\"Uruguay\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 347,\n            'f': \"347\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.16-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 37,\n            'f': \"37\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999592304229736,\n            'f': \"0.9999592304229736\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Amor\\u00edn (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, I would like to pay tribute to the memory of His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the State of Kuwait. First, on behalf of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, I would like to extend sincere condolences to the Government and the people of Kuwait and to the Permanent Mission of the State of Kuwait to the United Nations on the passing of His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah. His Highness had been at the helm of the State of Kuwait since 2006 but his statesmanship was shaped over many years before that, during which he held several Government posts, including those of Foreign Minister, Finance Minister and Prime Minister. Consequently, his extensive experience in Government made him an expert on his country\\u2019s policies for 50 years. His leadership was inspired as stability was achieved. He did notable work in serving as a mediator in various crises and conf licts in the region and made significant contributions at critical junctures in his country\\u2019s history. As Head of State, he also played a key role in maintaining stability within the Gulf Cooperation Council. This is also the right time to recall his work as a humanitarian, especially his generous contribution to efforts to ease the suffering of thousands of refugees. His work was recognized by the Organization in 2014 when the then-Secretary-General honoured him for his exemplary humanitarianism as one of the world\\u2019s great leaders. People such as His Highness Sheikh Al-Jaber Al-Sabah inspire the international community and our policy decisions and continue foster understanding, concord and good relations among peoples. \",\n\"{'Action': 4.773238515554112e-07, 'ActionObject': 1.8361323128601725e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 4.68590911850697e-07, 'Body': 8.52035775267268e-09, 'Clarification': 1.0725830890123689e-07, 'Conclusion': 8.782716065525165e-08, 'Election': 4.590840489981929e-06, 'General': 0.9999592304229736, 'Introduction': 2.6373127184342593e-05, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.5534751202371808e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 2.506713201455568e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 5.3450520454134676e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 4.651778453990119e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 2.347721874684794e-07, 'OralStatement': 1.5811368214713184e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.661276994331274e-07, 'RVRequested': 2.1605394806556433e-08, 'RVTaken': 2.2569262014826563e-08, 'Session': 4.1108822301794135e-07, 'Sponsorship': 2.0731350858227415e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.4088072930462658e-07, 'Vote': 2.01339139493939e-06, 'VotingIntention': 6.141656854197208e-07}\",\n[[\"Amor\\u00edn\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Uruguay\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the State of Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the State of Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sabah Al-Ahmad\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the State of Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"50 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"thousands\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2014\", \"DATE\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 348,\n            'f': \"348\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.16-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 38,\n            'f': \"38\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9980342984199524,\n            'f': \"0.9980342984199524\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The President: I now give the f loor to the representative of Liechtenstein, who will speak on behalf of the Group of Western European and other States.\",\n\"{'Action': 4.284754595573759e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.684372818999691e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 3.5330842820258113e-06, 'Body': 5.8467182206811685e-09, 'Clarification': 2.8618174496841675e-08, 'Conclusion': 7.519918199250242e-07, 'Election': 8.774386515142396e-07, 'General': 0.001933613675646484, 'Introduction': 0.9980342984199524, 'MeetingDateTime': 3.4863643083582474e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 7.490317699421212e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 2.4428702616319242e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 1.6538057252546423e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 1.2295987517063622e-07, 'OralStatement': 1.4831430354689257e-12, 'PresidingOfficer': 4.872295903624035e-06, 'RVRequested': 6.109060450398829e-06, 'RVTaken': 4.5604693355016934e-09, 'Session': 9.516226029404606e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.287791956405826e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 5.478466391650727e-06, 'Vote': 8.404246727877762e-06, 'VotingIntention': 1.5230799021992425e-07}\",\n[[\"Liechtenstein\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 349,\n            'f': \"349\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.16-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 39,\n            'f': \"39\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999961853027344,\n            'f': \"0.9999961853027344\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Group of Western European and other States.

We extend our sincere condolences to his family and to the people of Kuwait. He will be missed not only by the people of his country but also by his friends and admirers in the region and throughout the world, including the United States. As the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said, the Amir\\u2019s vision shaped Kuwait into the prosperous and modern State it is today, and his global leadership has resulted in lasting and positive change in Kuwait and the entire region of the Middle East. It is a testament to the strength of the many deep friendships that Sheikh Al-Sabah forged over the course of a life devoted to the peaceful resolution of disputes that he was known among many of those friends as the dean of Arab diplomacy. His life\\u2019s work \\u2014 first during his almost 40 years as Kuwait\\u2019s Foreign Minister, then as Prime Minister and, finally, as Amir \\u2014 was dedicated to peaceful dialogue and unity. Sheikh Al-Sabah was instrumental in the creation of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), truly one of his greatest legacies. In honour of his life\\u2019s work, we hope that the members of the GCC will recommit to healing the rift that he sought to mend during his last years. Sheikh Al-Sabah set Kuwait on a prosperous path to sustained peace and safety in cooperation with the GCC, in which he was a tireless mediator, capable of bridging apparently insurmountable divides in the pursuit of stability and security. His Highness Sheikh Al-Sabah was a revered leader and a friend to all nations. He led efforts to help rebuild relations with Iraq, thereby once again demonstrating his dedication to peaceful dialogue and coexistence. He was committed to action as well as to words and concepts. He gave generous political and economic support to Kuwait\\u2019s friends and neighbours in times of need. In recognition of his generosity, the United Nations named him a humanitarian leader in 2014. In 2018, he hosted a summit that produced $30 billion in pledges to help rebuild Iraq after the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham. Sheikh Al-Sabah hosted similar donor conferences to raise funds for Syrians suffering from their country\\u2019s civil war. An extraordinary architect of Kuwait\\u2019s humanitarian contributions in the world, Sheikh Al-Sabah personified the shared value that Kuwait and the United States place on helping the most vulnerable, and in doing so he promoted a safer and more secure world. The United States so valued the Amir\\u2019s strong partnership in promoting regional stability and security that President Trump awarded him the prestigious order of the Legion of Merit, Chief Commander, as a token of our country\\u2019s appreciation. And so today the United States mourns the loss of a dear friend, who distinguished himself by his exceptional leadership, humanitarianism and efforts to bring about a stable and more secure region. We mourn with the Kuwaiti people for the loss of such a wise and devoted leader. We honour his legacy and remain committed to our strong partnership and friendship with Kuwait. \",\n\"{'Action': 4.0566412451426e-09, 'ActionObject': 3.8183467498953405e-10, 'AgendaStatus': 2.2822113088238893e-09, 'Body': 1.9710042625797897e-11, 'Clarification': 2.0339410156111626e-09, 'Conclusion': 2.866915038701734e-10, 'Election': 4.054029290045946e-08, 'General': 0.9999998807907104, 'Introduction': 6.880409131326815e-08, 'MeetingDateTime': 5.266972413764393e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 1.7680725772351025e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 2.8746410807301004e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 1.2542661131931254e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 1.9182111454796313e-09, 'OralStatement': 3.180080920817119e-10, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.1649017306325504e-09, 'RVRequested': 2.9158123832084826e-11, 'RVTaken': 7.127324425093562e-11, 'Session': 1.767179291789489e-09, 'Sponsorship': 2.809105448253746e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 4.730414393527838e-10, 'Vote': 1.4717375762529628e-08, 'VotingIntention': 5.218387055805351e-09}\",\n[[\"Craft\", \"PERSON\"], [\"United States of America\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Mike Pompeo\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Amir\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"almost 40 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Amir\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Al-Sabah\", \"PERSON\"], [\"his last years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sheikh Al-Sabah set\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sheikh Al-Sabah\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Iraq\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2014\", \"DATE\"], [\"2018\", \"DATE\"], [\"Iraq\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Iraq\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sheikh Al-Sabah\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Amir\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Trump\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 352,\n            'f': \"352\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.16-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 42,\n            'f': \"42\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9989450573921204,\n            'f': \"0.9989450573921204\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The President: I now give the f loor to the representative of Egypt, who will speak on behalf of the Group of Arab States.\",\n\"{'Action': 3.152284833163321e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.0764415137032302e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 1.2563341442728415e-06, 'Body': 1.7644060656962779e-09, 'Clarification': 1.1337612626505233e-08, 'Conclusion': 2.1272576589126402e-07, 'Election': 9.520496746517892e-07, 'General': 0.0010283932788297534, 'Introduction': 0.9989450573921204, 'MeetingDateTime': 3.225505196269296e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 3.79079487800027e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 9.226472030832156e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 1.5929431640415714e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 1.2177881103525579e-07, 'OralStatement': 1.4072063284596703e-13, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.548944278009003e-06, 'RVRequested': 3.7435418107634177e-06, 'RVTaken': 1.2807752636234682e-09, 'Session': 5.694877902584494e-09, 'Sponsorship': 2.7913060751671992e-11, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.3575753402838018e-06, 'Vote': 1.4147582987789065e-05, 'VotingIntention': 4.677445630818511e-08}\",\n[[\"Egypt\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 353,\n            'f': \"353\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.16-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 43,\n            'f': \"43\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999759197235107,\n            'f': \"0.9999759197235107\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Edrees (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Group of Arab States. We are here today to bid farewell to a man whose death is a loss for Arab and Muslim nations. His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the State of Kuwait, has left us. However, he will live on through his noble endeavours, which bear witness to his work and legacy. Bidding farewell to His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah means saying goodbye to one of the symbols of our Arab nation, belonging to a generation of leaders, pioneers and founders of the nation-State project in the Arab world. The late Amir was a witness to all the major events that shaped the contemporary Arab world, including many varied challenges. He also felt the hopes and aspirations of the people in the region through the important posts and roles that he assumed after our sister State of Kuwait achieved independence. The late Amir held the post of Minister of Information in the first Kuwaiti Government, in 1961. In 1963 he became Minister for Foreign Affairs and held that post for nearly 40 years. He was also the first to raise the Kuwaiti f lag here at the United Nations when his country became a member of our Organization in 1963. On 13 July 2003 he was appointed Prime Minister of Kuwait, a post he held until on 29 January 2006, when he became Amir of the State of Kuwait, succeeding His Highness Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salim Al-Sabah. His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah worked to achieve the advancement of our sister State of Kuwait through the various posts he held. Thanks to him, Kuwaiti women were able to exercise their political rights. The first appointment of a woman as a Cabinet Minister came in 2005 after His Highness became Prime Minister during the reign of His Highness Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, and Kuwaiti women also entered Parliament when he became Amir. During the Amir\\u2019s reign, Kuwait witnessed comprehensive development progress in various sectors. The State of Kuwait enshrined the concept of citizenship, the rule of law and national unity. But His Highness\\u2019s contributions were not limited merely to the development of our sister State of Kuwait. On the contrary, he launched and made a number of initiatives and contributions at the international level. In 2007, for example, at the third Summit of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, held in Riyadh, he made a major donation to establish scientific research programmes related to the environment and climate change. In 2008 he established a Decent Life Fund, which enabled efforts to deal with the ongoing food crisis at the time. Kuwait also hosted several donor conferences in support of Syria in 2013, 2014 and 2015, in addition to an international donor conference in 2018 for the reconstruction of Iraq. The late Amir received several regional and international prizes in recognition of his work as a leader in the humanitarian field, including the Certificate of Appreciation awarded to him by the United Nations in September 2014. His country will therefore be remembered and acknowledged as one that has provided humanitarian assistance throughout the world. He received such accolades and expressions of gratitude from Arab and non-Arab States alike. With regard to international peace and security in the Arab region, in April 2016, under the auspices of the United Nations, His Highness hosted talks on bringing about peace in Yemen. The Amir also believed in the importance of deepening relations between Arab and African nations, which was why his country hosted the third African-Arab Summit in November 2013, and he launched several important initiatives aimed at strengthening relations between African and Arab countries and developing African States. The State of Kuwait made soft loans to several African States with a view to strengthening them in the areas of investment and infrastructure. In addition, his country established an annual $1 million prize to foster research related to development in Africa. At the African Union Summit in July 2012, the State of Kuwait announced that it would contribute to building the new African Commission headquarters in Addis Ababa. His Highness launched so many initiatives that it would be difficult to list them all here. I would nevertheless like to point to the crucial role that his country played in promoting Arab and Islamic issues, particularly the Palestinian cause, the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the establishment of an independent Palestinian State within the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. We will never forget the work of His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah in fostering the development and prosperity of his country. Lastly, we bid farewell today to a symbol of the nation and a man representative of a generation of pioneers in whom we in the Arab world take pride. We pray that the people of our sister State of Kuwait, as well as the other Arab and Islamic nations, will stay strong while mourning the death of Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah. May his soul rest in peace. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.0931997849183972e-06, 'ActionObject': 1.9115051941298589e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 3.338926717333379e-07, 'Body': 1.0592613008952867e-08, 'Clarification': 2.1932869742613548e-07, 'Conclusion': 4.6351516402864945e-08, 'Election': 5.232083367445739e-06, 'General': 0.9999759197235107, 'Introduction': 9.814648365136236e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 8.708747856189802e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 1.9395601214000635e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 5.192509888729546e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 3.7220311241981108e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 2.18940414242752e-07, 'OralStatement': 4.9188805917310674e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.8621747699398838e-07, 'RVRequested': 1.5997160929259735e-08, 'RVTaken': 2.2560730172926924e-08, 'Session': 3.10645731360637e-07, 'Sponsorship': 9.427992608834757e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.125024280985599e-07, 'Vote': 1.3027361092099454e-06, 'VotingIntention': 5.423594302556012e-07}\",\n[[\"Edrees\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Egypt\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sabah Al-Ahmad\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the State of Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah\", \"PERSON\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Amir\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Amir\", \"PERSON\"], [\"1961\", \"DATE\"], [\"1963\", \"DATE\"], [\"nearly 40 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"1963\", \"DATE\"], [\"13 July 2003\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"29 January 2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"the State of Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Saad Al-Abdullah\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Sabah Al-Ahmad\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"2005\", \"DATE\"], [\"Amir\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2007\", \"DATE\"], [\"2008\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2013\", \"DATE\"], [\"2014\", \"DATE\"], [\"2015\", \"DATE\"], [\"2018\", \"DATE\"], [\"Iraq\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Amir\", \"PERSON\"], [\"September 2014\", \"DATE\"], [\"April 2016\", \"PARA\"], [\"Yemen\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Amir\", \"PERSON\"], [\"third\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"November 2013\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"July 2012\", \"DATE\"], [\"the State of Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"1967\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sabah Al-Ahmad\", \"PERSON\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah\", \"PERSON\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 354,\n            'f': \"354\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.16-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 44,\n            'f': \"44\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9988117218017578,\n            'f': \"0.9988117218017578\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The President: I now give the f loor to the representative of the United Arab Emirates, who will speak on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.\",\n\"{'Action': 1.369930089367699e-07, 'ActionObject': 6.29882705993623e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 2.590994199636043e-06, 'Body': 2.5543613446643576e-08, 'Clarification': 3.894289690720143e-08, 'Conclusion': 1.6242472611338599e-06, 'Election': 1.2398054423101712e-06, 'General': 0.0011193009559065104, 'Introduction': 0.9988117218017578, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.0288850660344906e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 2.3269986115792562e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 5.728664120852045e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 1.6550235159229487e-05, 'MeetingStatus': 1.21299180477763e-07, 'OralStatement': 7.324585382662008e-12, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.828708031505812e-06, 'RVRequested': 1.0213609130005352e-05, 'RVTaken': 2.0101643016801063e-08, 'Session': 3.989165264783878e-08, 'Sponsorship': 2.1662782678788517e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.6575319023104385e-05, 'Vote': 1.51777367136674e-05, 'VotingIntention': 5.930727979830408e-07}\",\n[[\"the United Arab Emirates\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 355,\n            'f': \"355\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.16-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 45,\n            'f': \"45\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999992847442627,\n            'f': \"0.9999992847442627\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Nusseibeh (United Arab Emirates): On behalf of the member States of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), I express our heartfelt and sincere condolences to the honourable Al-Sabah family and to the Government and the people of Kuwait, following the passing on 29 September of His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the State of Kuwait. His death is an immense loss to the Islamic world and to advocates for peace, humanity and mediation around the globe. The late Amir of Kuwait left an outstanding legacy of advocacy for multilateralism and preventive diplomacy. His Highness demonstrated wisdom, compassion and strength in the most challenging moments to bring peace and stability to the region and beyond. He has been recognized globally and here in this Hall today as an exceptional leader who sought peace and supported humanitarian causes. He worked tirelessly to mediate conf licts in the region and all around the world. His Highness mobilized the international community on many occasions to support people in the most vulnerable situations. His empathy for those in need was ref lected in his dedication and generous contributions to numerous global humanitarian causes. We also recall Kuwait\\u2019s active role within the OIC, successfully hosting the fifth session of the Islamic Summit Conference in 1987, when His Highness was Kuwait\\u2019s Foreign Minister, as well as the forty-second session of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the OIC in 2015, when His Highness had become Amir of Kuwait. At home, His Highness built Kuwait into the great country that it is today. For more than 50 years, he served his country with honour and grace. He promoted peaceful coexistence and interfaith and intercultural dialogue at the national, regional and global levels. He called for unity and development for people everywhere. He was also dedicated to empowering women and young people, to cite only a few of his numerous achievements. We will always remember His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah as a distinguished leader and a great friend to our nations and peoples, a man who built bridges of peace and understanding between countries. May he rest in peace. We reiterate our condolences to the Government of Kuwait, and we would also like to wish His Highness Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the new Amir of Kuwait, every success in serving his country and supporting international peace and security. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.457756759748463e-08, 'ActionObject': 3.2534333005429517e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 1.3290302192103809e-08, 'Body': 1.511373942664207e-10, 'Clarification': 7.663969014970462e-09, 'Conclusion': 2.459955128486513e-09, 'Election': 1.3423817790680914e-07, 'General': 0.9999992847442627, 'Introduction': 4.421969492796052e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.6804289071359335e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 6.1995022448968484e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 1.364285906468865e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 1.1394037358058995e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 6.220301163040176e-09, 'OralStatement': 1.3826364497759869e-09, 'PresidingOfficer': 4.736137704242083e-09, 'RVRequested': 3.3231156715274324e-10, 'RVTaken': 4.391125241198779e-10, 'Session': 8.088868241884484e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.789892567494178e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.3831789874861897e-09, 'Vote': 4.7688725857142344e-08, 'VotingIntention': 2.149925393268859e-08}\",\n[[\"Nusseibeh\", \"PERSON\"], [\"United Arab Emirates\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"29\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the State of Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Amir\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"conf\", \"PERSON\"], [\"ref\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"fifth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"1987\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2015\", \"DATE\"], [\"Amir\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"more than 50 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sabah Al-Ahmad\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Nawaf Al-Ahmad\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 356,\n            'f': \"356\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.16-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 46,\n            'f': \"46\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.999981164932251,\n            'f': \"0.999981164932251\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The President: I now give the f loor to the Permanent Representative of Kuwait.\",\n\"{'Action': 5.032880223687641e-10, 'ActionObject': 4.499210337627346e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 2.8977811439290235e-07, 'Body': 4.5507325685534283e-10, 'Clarification': 7.054338224676826e-10, 'Conclusion': 2.310859059662107e-07, 'Election': 3.823619199039285e-09, 'General': 1.582460754434578e-05, 'Introduction': 0.999981164932251, 'MeetingDateTime': 3.601627329707924e-11, 'MeetingLocation': 2.1083432777402322e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 1.4838349438051068e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 3.6826841665060783e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 3.3070219895847686e-09, 'OralStatement': 1.868318528857292e-14, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.4572486861652578e-07, 'RVRequested': 1.6944384242378874e-06, 'RVTaken': 1.8563729720089128e-10, 'Session': 1.6363885246839516e-10, 'Sponsorship': 1.8531519634795712e-12, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.316649497264734e-07, 'Vote': 3.3657077125326396e-08, 'VotingIntention': 7.172542115796432e-09}\",\n[[\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 357,\n            'f': \"357\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.16-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 47,\n            'f': \"47\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999998807907104,\n            'f': \"0.9999998807907104\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): On Tuesday, 29 September, Kuwait bade farewell to the leader of its journey. We received the news with hearts replete with faith in our acceptance of God\\u2019s will. Death is a fact and a part of life. The Amir\\u2019s departure, however, is difficult. We seek comfort in the words of God, who when disaster falls instructs us to say, \\u201cWe belong to Allah, and to Him we shall return\\u201d (The Holy Qur\\u2019an,2:156). We would like to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation to you, Mr. President, for holding this special session of the General Assembly to pay tribute to the late Amir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah. May he rest in peace in God\\u2019s heaven. We also thank the Secretary-General and those who have spoken today on behalf of the regional groups for their kind and heartfelt words. The Government and the people of Kuwait are grateful to all who have shared in our sorrow and offered us their condolences on the loss of our deceased as well as the deceased of the Arab and Muslim nations. The Amir dedicated his life to serving his nation and defending its causes in every regional and international forum for more than six decades. History will remember his steadfastness and his long journey. It will remember all that he contributed to Kuwait\\u2019s development, stability and security, as well as what he did to enhance the prosperity of his people and ensure that they assumed their rightful place among the nations of the world. The late Amir\\u2019s life was marked by numerous achievements, illustrated by the many offices he held throughout his life. He made his mark in the cultural, media, economic and political arenas. His legacy is also embodied in huge architectural and development projects dedicated to education and culture, which will continue to advertise the history of Kuwait as well as the progress and development that the country has accomplished so far. During the Amir\\u2019s reign, Kuwait made great strides in human development that reached every sector of society. The late Amir believed that young people hold the key to our future and that we need them if we are to continue on the way to development and prosperity. He always supported and encouraged young people while incentivizing them to use and channel their creative energy to serve their country and its educational and cultural institutions, whose purpose is their betterment. During the late Amir\\u2019s reign, women were able to effectively exercise their political rights. In 2006 they participated as voters and candidates in parliamentary elections for the first time. His Highness played an important part in advancing the role of women and their status in society. He laid the foundation for developing a legislative framework that has enabled women to enjoy all their rights, empower themselves and participate in political decision-making. He also appointed women to ministerial and high-level posts and increased their representation in various State institutions, including in the areas of security and the judiciary. In addition, there were many bright moments and achievements for Kuwaiti diplomacy during the late Amir\\u2019s reign. Guided by his wisdom, he was able to navigate the troubled waters of our region and see Kuwait safely to shore. He was able to maintain our country\\u2019s security, stability and prosperity while working with determination to achieve unity among the nations of the Gulf and the Arab and Islamic world. He worked tirelessly to overcome crises and made use of the deep trust placed in him as a mediator to resolve conf licts and heal divisions in many regions. The Amir\\u2019s work was based on goodwill and a sincere desire to achieve peace, security and stability, as well as to end bloodshed and channel efforts and resources towards developing and realizing the aspirations of the people and the region. He did not falter in defending issues related to the destinies of Arab and Islamic nations, particularly the Palestinian question, where he supported the choices of the Palestinian people. He held to the relevant international terms of reference and Security Council resolutions as the way to bring about a just, comprehensive and lasting solution leading ultimately to a two-State solution and the establishment of a Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital. He was right in laying a strong foundation for Kuwait\\u2019s foreign policy based on reason, moderation and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which call for respect for the sovereignty of States, non-interference in others\\u2019 internal affairs and refraining from the use or threat of use of force while resolving conf licts through peaceful means, as well as for establishing relations based on mutual respect and good neighbourliness. After he became Head of State in 2006, the Amir continued his efforts aimed at achieving international and regional cooperation through his hosting of many economic, social and humanitarian conferences. He launched noble initiatives aimed at increasing partnership among nations, eliminating poverty, maintaining human dignity and alleviating the suffering of people affected by natural or other disasters, regardless of their nationality, colour, race or religion. He also took many initiatives designed to promote sustainable development. With its various establishments and funds, Kuwait has been active in pursuing sustainable development and continues to support development and humanitarian programmes in many developing and least developed countries. The international community recognized the role that the late Amir played in supporting United Nations humanitarian aid efforts. In 2014, the then- Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon conferred the distinction of humanitarian leader on the late Amir and on Kuwait as a humanitarian centre. The late Amir believed in collective international action and was a staunch supporter and defender of the purposes and principles enshrined in international law and the Charter. He called for peace and tolerance, rejecting hatred, violence and intolerance while supporting the United Nations as an indispensable international tool for confronting international threats and dangers. In that regard, I would like to quote the late Amir in his first address from this rostrum after Kuwait joined the United Nations in 1963. At the time, the late Amir was the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kuwait. You cited the same address in your statement, Mr. President: \\u201cKuwait\\u2019s participation in these international activities clearly indicates that it does not look on independence and membership of the United Nations as ends in themselves. It considers them rather as a means of sharing in the responsibility, of securing a better life for its people and for the people of other nations.\\u201d (A/PV.1203, para. 114) May he rest in peace. He was an Amir of humanity and modesty, and we ask Almighty God to embrace him in his mercy and graciousness, give him a place in heaven and reward him for all the good that he did for his people and his nation and for humankind as a whole. His achievements will continue to be a shining and sustained testament to all his efforts, while his memory will continue to live in the minds and hearts of his people. We wish every success for the new Amir of Kuwait, His Highness Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, and his Crown Prince, Sheikh Mishaal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, as they continue on the path of contributing to the welfare of Kuwait, its people, the region and the world at large. In conclusion, we once again thank you, Mr. President, for holding this meeting, and we also thank the Secretary-General and all those who spoke, attended and offered their condolences. Kuwait will remain on its path and in its commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter, defending its noble message of peace, tolerance and justice as an active member of the United Nations. We will continue to assist international efforts to improve people\\u2019s lives and maintain human dignity. \",\n\"{'Action': 9.266690526033017e-09, 'ActionObject': 3.8167029536850805e-09,

     },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Su\\u00e1rez Moreno (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has joined the consensus that has made it possible to adopt resolution 75/2. However, we must reiterate that this should in no way be interpreted as an endorsement, validation or recognition on our part of the most recent report of the Committee on Contributions (A/75/11). That is because despite the fact that the Committee is a technical body, the internal discussions of the request that Venezuela made at the time were deliberately exploited by some of the Committee\\u2019s members to advance petty national political interests and prevent our delegation from participating, by depriving it not only of a voice but also of a vote in the intergovernmental processes that take place within the framework of the General Assembly, thereby blocking the existing majority consensus from recommending that our country also be granted the corresponding exemptions. Venezuela is one of several countries whose right to vote in the General Assembly has been suspended since January 2020, pursuant to the provisions of Article 19 of the Charter of the United Nations. Today my country is still unable to fully enjoy its rights and privileges within the Organization, including voting. That is because despite having the financial means to do so \\u2014 as we have shown and as the Secretariat is aware \\u2014 it has been impossible for us to honour our financial commitments, for reasons clearly beyond our control. The ever-increasing magnitude and scope of the illegal economic, commercial and financial blockade that the United States Government has unilaterally imposed on our country, in flagrant violation of the Charter and the norms of international law, has had extraterritorial consequences that are exacerbated by the policy of persecution and extortion that the same Government carries out against any entity that enters into commercial relations or other types of entirely legal transactions with Venezuela. We are therefore not only cut off from regular access to the international financial system, but companies and individuals are threatened by so-called secondary sanctions and forced into a position of violating international law, as has in fact already happened with companies and individuals who have nothing to do with our country. That is the reason why it has become virtually impossible to effectively transfer the funds needed to pay our arrears to the United Nations. This situation has been brought to the attention of the Secretary-General as well as that of the Committee on Relations with the Host Country and the Committee on Contributions since last year. You yourself, Mr. President, like your predecessor and the membership of the Organization, have been informed in detail of this injustice. Unfortunately, nothing concrete, practical or even remotely tangible has been done so far. In the interests of transparency, I should mention that seven weeks ago the United States Government issued a new licence, which is supposed to end this unfortunate situation. Since then, we have tried to work with it to test its effectiveness. However, what we have seen so far is that the document has had the same effect as the two previously issued licences \\u2014 which is to say none whatever. In practice, United States licences change nothing. Moreover, as the United States delegation has been covering for itself here by saying that its Government has already issued a licence and that everything has been resolved, its authorities in Washington, D.C., have been threatening banks with the consequences of doing business with Venezuelan sources, something that was even confirmed recently by Mr. Elliott Abrams in a statement to the press. My country is not asking for its debt to be cancelled or to be exempted from honouring its international obligations. We possess both the economic resources and the political will needed to pay our arrears to the United Nations. As is obvious from the evidence at hand, however, we are facing a situation in which \\u2014 although Venezuela has the financial resources to fulfil its commitments in terms of quotas and contributions to the Organization \\u2014 every channel for making that payment has been blocked. We therefore call for the complete and immediate lifting of all the unilateral coercive measures and other limitations that have been imposed on us to prevent our delegation from fully and effectively exercising its responsibilities and thereby complying with the purposes of the United Nations. Venezuela reaffirms its commitment to continuing to take every possible step and redoubling its efforts to end this injustice. At the same time, we are asking the General Assembly and you, Mr. President, to exercise your good offices with the relevant authorities of the host country, in coordination with the Secretariat, in order to establish a financial channel that will ensure that our payments reach their final destination effectively and safely, without being illegally or arbitrarily rejected or confiscated, thereby enabling us to finally settle our debt to the Organization and freely exercise all our rights and privileges. In conclusion, using coercion to control legal efforts is impermissible and should be categorically rejected. Let us remember that today it is Venezuela, but tomorrow any other State Member of the Organization could be subjected to the United States Government\\u2019s campaign of so-called maximum pressure. We must therefore all unite to defend the principle of the legal equality of States and the integrity of the Headquarters Agreement, and to end once and for all the United States Government\\u2019s abuse of its role as host country to the United Nations through its use of coercion, threats and blackmail to advance petty national political interests. \",\n\"{'Action': 7.820081471265894e-09, 'ActionObject': 3.1829163749108602e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 3.239022916545764e-08, 'Body': 7.221855058414661e-11, 'Clarification': 3.732567677161569e-08, 'Conclusion': 2.259222364742186e-09, 'Election': 1.1028546076374823e-08, 'General': 0.9999998807907104, 'Introduction': 6.051579504173787e-08, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.6702167144065925e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 8.134205309318077e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 7.621461795004336e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 7.914149335874754e-09, 'MeetingStatus': 1.0291545393670276e-08, 'OralStatement': 2.261133147385408e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 6.484571990483801e-09, 'RVRequested': 6.741453922876062e-11, 'RVTaken': 3.214107313631587e-10, 'Session': 1.3093993667112613e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.0617134948986973e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.7465078272493884e-09, 'Vote': 5.310035966488158e-09, 'VotingIntention': 5.2313449572238824e-08}\",\n[[\"Su\\u00e1rez Moreno\", \"PERSON\"], [\"resolution 75/2\", \"R\"], [\"A/75/11\", \"Symbol\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"suspended\", \"MS\"], [\"January 2020\", \"DATE\"], [\"Today\", \"DATE\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Charter\", \"PERSON\"], [\"secondary\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"last year\", \"DATE\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"seven weeks ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Elliott Abrams\", \"PERSON\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"tomorrow\", \"DATE\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 370,\n            'f': \"370\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.16-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 60,\n            'f': \"60\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999979734420776,\n            'f': \"0.9999979734420776\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mrs. Rodr\\u00edguez Abascal (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): My delegation endorses the statement made by the Deputy Permanent Representative of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.

this statement: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Ukraine. The European Union welcomes the recent positive developments in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and parts of the northern West Bank, the Agreement on Movement and Access and the subsequent opening of the Rafah border on 25 November 2005, and the forthcoming multiparty elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council foreseen for 25 January 2006 all represent significant steps towards implementation of the road map. While recognizing that more remains to be done, the European Union believes that such developments should be taken into account when considering the role of existing United Nations structures. Equally, the European Union has consistently supported the objective of streamlining in the General Assembly as part of the overall process of revitalization of the Assembly. In that respect, the European Union was pleased that in the Third Committee this year, the Palestinian observer delegation was willing to withdraw its resolution on Palestinian children incorporating relevant elements into another existing resolution. The European Union also supports the updating and re-examination of existing United Nations structures, such as the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, to better take into account political developments and realities on the ground. The EU looks forward to further discussions on this issue. The European Union has, in the past, had some reservations about the terms of reference of that United Nations body, as it felt that it does not sufficiently reflect the spirit of the peace process. Nevertheless, since the EU now has two Member States that have historically held a different view, our voting pattern will respect that position and reflect it accordingly. The EU remains committed to the two-State solution as laid out in the road map and agreed between the parties, which would result in a viable, contiguous, sovereign and independent Palestinian State existing side by side in peace with Israel, both living within recognized and secure borders. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.51587175878376e-06, 'ActionObject': 3.597120326048753e-07, 'AgendaStatus':

With respect to the resolution entitled \\u201cDivision for Palestinian Rights of the Secretariat\\u201d, as we indicated last year, Canada questions the value of the work of that Division. We believe that the time has come for the General Assembly to assess the effectiveness of that particular body and to consider reassigning resources to the implementation of activities more strategic to the protection and promotion of Palestinian rights and to the achievement of a peaceful settlement. Canada voted against draft resolution A/60/L.29 for those reasons. Finally, with respect to the resolution entitled \\u201cPeaceful settlement of the question of Palestine\\u201d, Canada considers it imperative that an explicit and unequivocal condemnation of suicide bombing be included in a resolution pertaining to the peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine. In the absence of an explicit condemnation, Canada has taken the difficult decision to change its vote this year from support to abstention. That abstention should not be misinterpreted as signalling any kind of change in Canadian policy towards the Middle East peace process. We continue to firmly advocate support for the objectives of the road map. \",\n\"{'Action': 3.580622433219105e-06, 'ActionObject': 2.303302608197555e-06, 'AgendaStatus': 2.4605493308627047e-05, 'Body': 1.19391629027632e-07, 'Clarification': 6.1748892221658025e-06, 'Conclusion': 3.95166580346995e-06, 'Election': 6.657505196017155e-07, 'General': 0.9996103644371033, 'Introduction': 0.00028167013078927994, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.5618248028204107e-07, 'MeetingLocation': 1.994829290197231e-06, 'MeetingNumber': 3.0790616278864036e-07, 'MeetingSegment': 2.7150837922818027e-05, 'MeetingStatus': 2.1153432498977054e-06, 'OralStatement': 2.177738451791811e-06, 'PresidingOfficer': 5.158407930139219e-06, 'RVRequested': 2.8474653390730964e-07, 'RVTaken': 3.869101021791721e-07, 'Session': 2.1532817129354953e-07, 'Sponsorship': 1.2567531371132645e-07, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.8185967241588514e-06, 'Vote': 2.1647835524163384e-07, 'VotingIntention': 2.2536327378475107e-05}\",\n[[\"Laurin\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Canada\", \"UNPE\"], [\"entitled \\u201cCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"Canada\", \"UNPE\"], [\"entitled \\u201cDivision for Palestinian Rights of the Secretariat\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"last year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Canada\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Canada\", \"UNPE\"], [\"draft resolution A/60/L.29\", \"DR\"], [\"entitled \\u201cPeaceful settlement of the question of Palestine\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"Canada\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Canada\", \"UNPE\"], [\"this year\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 534,\n            'f': \"534\",\n        },\n\"A_60_PV.60-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 50,\n            'f': \"50\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999896287918091,\n            'f': \"0.9999896287918091\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Rivero (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): Uruguay wishes once again to express its conviction that a return to the road map is essential and urgent in order to complete the peace process and achieve as soon as possible a just and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East.

Australia is concerned that a number of resolutions of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly are unbalanced in their criticism of Israel. The singling out of one side only for blame in the current situation is deeply unhelpful. Australia remains concerned at the high level of United Nations Secretariat resources allocated to anti- Israeli activity, including the Division for Palestinian Rights of the Secretariat and the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. The annual resolutions endorsing those work units do nothing to streamline or rationalize the Secretariat\\u2019s structure or make its work more balanced. Similarly, the Special Information Programme on the Question of Palestine of the Secretariat\\u2019s Department of Public Information is not a constructive use of United Nations resources, or does it help make the Secretariat\\u2019s work more balanced. Those resolutions serve only to distract the parties from more pressing issues and do nothing to help the peace process. \",\n\"{'Action': 4.2881156332441606e-06, 'ActionObject':

I would like to explain the vote by the countries of the European Union on the resolution on the Syrian Golan. The European Union remains concerned about the situation in the Middle East. It reiterates to all parties the importance of maintaining forward momentum towards full implementation of the road map. There can be no military solution to the Middle East conflict. A just, lasting and comprehensive settlement of the situation in the Middle East, including on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, must be based on Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which emphasizes the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force and the need to work for a just and lasting peace in which every State in the region can live in security, and on subsequent Security Council resolutions 338 (1973), 1397 (2002) and 1515 (2003). It must be based on the terms of reference of the Madrid Conference, in particular the principle of land for peace, as well as on the implementation of the road map and all existing agreements between the parties. We will continue to work relentlessly with the regional parties, as part of the Middle East Quartet, towards that goal. The European Union wishes to reiterate that a final peace settlement will not be complete without taking account of the Israel-Syria and Israel-Lebanon aspects. Negotiations should resume as soon as possible with the aim of reaching an agreement. It should be recalled that, earlier this month, the European Union voted in favour of the resolution on the Syrian Golan in the Fourth Committee, which called upon Israel to desist from changing the demographic composition of the occupied Syrian Golan and, in particular, to desist from the establishment of settlements. We believe that the resolution on the Syrian Golan under today\\u2019s agenda item contains references that could undermine the process of bilateral negotiations. For that reason, as in previous years, the European Union abstained in the voting on that resolution. Finally, in the spirit of rationalizing the work of the General Assembly, the European Union would prefer to have only one resolution dealing with this issue before this body. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.2532697155620554e-06, 'ActionObject': 2.942820174212102e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 1.4956224276829744e-06, 'Body': 3.733303088893081e-08, 'Clarification': 1.1103438737336546e-06, 'Conclusion': 5.051782636655844e-07, 'Election': 9.916506087392918e-07, 'General': 0.9999451637268066, 'Introduction': 1.3548552487918641e-05, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.4443871521052642e-07, 'MeetingLocation': 8.985547879092337e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 1.1597479954161827e-07, 'MeetingSegment': 2.143004530807957e-05, 'MeetingStatus': 3.482315946712333e-07, 'OralStatement': 1.3074717344352393e-06, 'PresidingOfficer': 4.362066761132155e-07, 'RVRequested': 2.7705478800044148e-08, 'RVTaken': 1.3314389946117444e-07, 'Session': 2.585755396466993e-07, 'Sponsorship': 7.459275366272777e-07, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.2456652029868565e-06, 'Vote': 6.251471518226026e-07, 'VotingIntention': 8.09490211395314e-06}\",\n[[\"Davis\", \"PERSON\"], [\"United Kingdom\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"the European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Bulgaria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Romania\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Croatia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Albania\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Bosnia and Herzegovina\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Serbia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Montenegro\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Liechtenstein\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Ukraine\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"resolution 242\", \"R\"], [\"1967\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolutions 338\", \"R\"], [\"1973\", \"DATE\"], [\"1397\", \"DATE\"], [\"2002\", \"DATE\"], [\"1515\", \"DATE\"], [\"2003\", \"DATE\"], [\"European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"earlier this month\", \"DATE\"], [\"the European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Fourth Committee\", \"C\"], [\"Israel\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"previous years\", \"DATE\"], [\"the European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"only one\", \"CARDINAL\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 558,\n            'f': \"558\",\n        },\n\"A_60_PV.60-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 74,\n            'f': \"74\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999988079071045,\n            'f': \"0.9999988079071045\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Mayoral (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): I wish to explain the votes cast by the delegations of Brazil and Argentina on resolution 60/40 on the Syrian Golan, just adopted by the General Assembly. Brazil and Argentina voted in favour of the resolution because it is our understanding that its principal and fundamental thrust relates to the illegality of the acquisition of territories by force. Paragraph 4 of Article 2 of the United Nations Charter prohibits the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity of any State. That is undoubtedly an imperative norm of international law. At the same time, I must clarify the position of our two delegations with respect to operative paragraph 6 of the resolution. We wish to specify that our vote does not prejudge the contents of that paragraph, and in particular the reference to the line of 4 June 1967. I take this opportunity, on behalf of the Governments of Argentina and Brazil, to reiterate our appeal to the authorities of Israel and Syria to resume negotiations with a view to finding a definitive solution to the situation of the Syrian Golan in conformity with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and in accordance with the principle of land for peace. \",\n\"{'Action': 5.269414060649069e-08, 'ActionObject': 8.707265131135955e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 3.8921790235235676e-08, 'Body': 5.194377150630203e-10, 'Clarification': 5.067294139848855e-08, 'Conclusion': 1.1784256237490354e-08, 'Election': 2.8439153254566918e-08, 'General': 0.9999988079071045, 'Introduction': 3.2663865567883477e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.6762763116749966e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 2.473377769263152e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 1.9384489569063135e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 2.702485915051511e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 1.643908298376573e-08, 'OralStatement': 6.409522512740295e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.7427231213673622e-08, 'RVRequested': 2.749824257186617e-10, 'RVTaken': 2.4507516016569753e-09, 'Session': 6.616940773085389e-09, 'Sponsorship': 8.492918368574465e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.4889112165406004e-08, 'Vote': 9.016451585353025e-09, 'VotingIntention': 2.580536033747194e-07}\",\n[[\"Mayoral\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Argentina\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Brazil\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Argentina\", \"UNPE\"], [\"resolution 60/40\", \"R\"], [\"Brazil\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Argentina\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Paragraph 4\", \"PARA\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"operative paragraph 6\", \"PARA\"], [\"4 June 1967\", \"DATE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Argentina\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Brazil\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Israel\", \"UNPE\"], [\"resolutions 242\", \"R\"], [\"1967\", \"DATE\"], [\"338\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"1973\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 559,\n            'f': \"559\",\n        },\n\"A_60_PV.60-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 75,\n            'f': \"75\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999898672103882,\n            'f': \"0.9999898672103882\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Laurin (Canada) (spoke in French): With respect to resolution 60/40 on the Syrian Golan, Canada noted last year that the resolution assigns to a 7 single party, Israel, the responsibility for resuming negotiations while in reality confidence-building measures and gestures of good will are necessary on both sides. We do not approve the annual submission of this resolution in the plenary, while a resolution of the Fourth Committee on the issue of the Syrian Golan, which enjoys considerable support, is adopted by the General Assembly every year. That is why we voted against the resolution.

We are very gratified that additional countries have shifted their votes by voting in support of those programmes, and we are extremely delighted to see such results. 8 Today, the voting has sent a strong message of encouragement and support to the Palestinian people, who are living under occupation and suffering tremendously under the ruthless system of occupation, and stated in a clear way to them that the Assembly will continue its support until the Israeli occupation is terminated and the independent Palestinian State is established on all of the land that was occupied by Israel in 1967, including East Jerusalem. Our people are not interested in resolutions. They are more interested in moving from this aisle where I sit to a seat among those who represent their own countries here. We want to be as equal as anybody else. We have been denied that right for the longest time, and to those who think we are interested in resolutions and who characterize those resolutions as biased and one-sided, we say that what is biased and one-sided is the action of the Israeli occupation. What is more violent: words and resolutions, or the actions of the Israeli occupation army? To those who think that these resolutions are anti-Israel, we simply say that these resolutions are upholding international law and that it is the business of the United Nations and the General Assembly to respect international law and to uphold it. If Israel or any country violates international law, it is our collective responsibility to tell that party \\u2014 be it Israel or any other \\u2014 that nobody is above international law. We would kindly ask those countries that lecture us about the programmes of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and others being unbalanced and anti-Israel to study carefully what those programmes are doing. When the Committee is actively trying to have activities in Europe, and maybe in Japan and other countries to support the Quartet process and the peace process at the political and the economic levels, does that contradict what we are doing, or is it contributing an additional effort to move the peace process forward? Again, we are very, very proud of this moment, and we hope that we can engage in intensive discussions and dialogue with those who hold different opinions \\u2014 and they are in the extreme minority \\u2014 so that we can perhaps achieve a mutual understanding and the voting might be different. In this connection, I want to express our thanks and gratitude to many countries and groups, including the European Union. We negotiated with them during the course of the last three months with a positive, constructive and flexible attitude. We are proud of the fact that we were able to accomplish many positive things, and both sides accommodated each other in a positive way. We declare our commitment to maintain the positive spirit that our side has demonstrated in this exercise, in order to accomplish much more. I should also like to declare our willingness to other countries, including one country that, unfortunately, changed its vote. We negotiated with that country in a very positive spirit and will continue to do so. We hope that when we negotiate in a positive spirit we will be rewarded, not punished. I should like to conclude my intervention by reiterating our deep appreciation and thanks to those who co-sponsored our resolutions as well as to those who voted in favour of them. We hope that next year the Palestinian people will be very much closer to accomplishing their objective of having their own independent Palestinian State, with Jerusalem as its capital. \",\n\"{'Action': 5.116730372733969e-10, 'ActionObject': 1.4985897245356483e-10, 'AgendaStatus': 4.2428976998465373e-10, 'Body': 9.172802491533294e-13, 'Clarification': 1.0590984755864952e-09, 'Conclusion': 4.524522770332773e-11, 'Election': 1.7372748795096982e-09, 'General': 1.0, 'Introduction': 1.2514226988002974e-08, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.615517025710389e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 2.303938706482711e-10, 'MeetingNumber': 1.7646042613228552e-11, 'MeetingSegment': 1.2675985261445533e-10, 'MeetingStatus': 3.9580752564383204e-10, 'OralStatement': 5.0363914427808965e-11, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.2639319025307145e-10, 'RVRequested': 2.3260048401252398e-12, 'RVTaken': 4.794640812849638e-12, 'Session': 5.89180024213043e-11, 'Sponsorship': 2.6353481896723707e-11, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 5.2542071388161915e-11, 'Vote': 1.9916817084464356e-09, 'VotingIntention': 1.2725628328880134e-09}\",\n[[\"Mansour\", \"PERSON\"], [\"this morning\", \"TIME\"], [\"8\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Israel\", \"UNPE\"], [\"1967\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolutions,\", \"R\"], [\"Israel\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Israel\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Japan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the last three months\", \"DATE\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"next year\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 564,\n            'f': \"564\",\n        },\n\"A_60_PV.60-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 80,\n            'f': \"80\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999955892562866,\n            'f': \"0.9999955892562866\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): Allow me to express my delegation\\u2019s appreciation for the adoption by the General Assembly, moments ago, of the resolution on the Syrian Golan and the other resolutions on the Palestinian question. The outstanding votes in favour of the resolutions, including that on the Syrian Golan, reflect one very clear fact: the support of the international community of our right to recover our lands occupied by Israel. That occupation has gone on for the last 38 years. We have listened to some colleagues commenting on rationalizing and streamlining the work of the General Assembly, including reducing the number of resolutions adopted. I am sincere when I say that we are all for it. However, it is truly regrettable that the enthusiasm for rationalization is present only when resolutions on the Middle East and Palestine are submitted \\u2014 and this at a time when resolutions proliferate and mushroom due to actions by the same people who call for rationalization in other areas which serve certain interests and objectives. These, we believe, are among the aspects that truly require rationalization. We would have hoped for a single consistent standard. The overwhelming majority of Member States support the United Nations programmes on the Middle East and Palestine, and we are quite satisfied with that. In conclusion, I would like to stress Syria\\u2019s great appreciation to those Member States that sponsored the resolution on the Syrian Golan and the States that voted in favour of that resolution. I would also like to stress that Syria will forever remain sincere in its call for the realization of a just and comprehensive peace, something that continues to be rejected by the Israeli Government. We hope that States calling for the realization of this just and comprehensive peace will address the relevant party in reference to this matter and bring pressure to bear on Israel to resume the peace process, which we believe is the only way to realize a promising future in the Middle East region. \",\n\"{'Action': 8.351597813316403e-08, 'ActionObject': 5.491023813419815e-08, 'AgendaStatus':

great pleasure to introduce the draft resolution contained in 2 document A/60/L.34, entitled \\u201cAssistance to survivors of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, particularly orphans, widows and victims of sexual violence\\u201d, in our capacity as the representative of the Chairman of the African Union and on behalf of the African Group, which has strongly endorsed this draft resolution. In addition to the sponsors listed in the document, the following States have joined in sponsorship: Angola, Armenia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Jamaica, Kenya, Mauritius, Netherlands, Sudan, Sweden, Timor-Leste and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The tragic events that occurred in Rwanda from April to July 1994 are among the darkest and most dreadful in human history. Up to one million lives were lost. One million ordinary men, women and children were condemned to die for no other reason beside the fact that they belonged to a particular ethnic group or identified with a particular ethnic group. The Rwandan genocide inflicted untold suffering on those who survived it. The most vulnerable groups of survivors were children and women. The children, apart from the trauma of watching their parents and siblings being slaughtered, were orphaned by the genocide and left alone in the world to fend for themselves. Most of these children have since had to live in child-headed households. Similarly, women not only watched their husbands and children being killed, but also underwent unspeakable physical abuse, in particular, sexual violence, which resulted in HIV infection in more than 60 per cent of the cases. The draft resolution before us is intended to achieve two main objectives. First, it intends to encourage the international community to provide assistance to these vulnerable groups. Secondly, it sets out, through the capacities of the United Nations, to build awareness of the events of 1994 so that the world will be a better place in which to live. It should be noted that, despite the best efforts of the Government of Rwanda and the support of the international community, many survivors remain very vulnerable and live in conditions of extreme poverty. We, the international community, must ensure that we do not disappoint the survivors of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda by failing to come to their assistance, once more, in their hour of need. My delegation coordinated four informal meetings to negotiate the draft before us. Much of the language in this draft resolution is agreed language from last year\\u2019s General Assembly resolution 59/137, which was adopted without a vote. Two new operative paragraphs are included in this draft. These paragraphs deal with the creation of educational and outreach programmes on the prevention of genocide and contain language identical to a resolution adopted by consensus during this session of the General Assembly. My delegation commends this draft resolution for the consideration of the General Assembly and looks forward to its adoption without a vote. \",\n\"{'Action': 3.2694686069589807e-07, 'ActionObject': 3.293505699275556e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 2.5874456355268194e-07, 'Body': 4.501529371481183e-09, 'Clarification': 4.966358346791822e-07, 'Conclusion': 7.017697356559438e-08, 'Election': 5.278394041852152e-07, 'General': 0.9999910593032837, 'Introduction': 3.406175437703496e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.5059065106015623e-07, 'MeetingLocation': 1.6299139815600938e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 2.620202010916728e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 6.232221494428813e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 9.729682659553873e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.329811141204118e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 9.720073279595454e-08, 'RVRequested': 7.174090210781969e-09, 'RVTaken': 1.6365278909802328e-08, 'Session': 6.16227211480691e-08, 'Sponsorship': 2.4036151557993435e-07, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.275910364029187e-07, 'Vote': 6.08580194239039e-07, 'VotingIntention': 1.0692923524402431e-06}\",\n[[\"Adekanye\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Nigeria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"2\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"A/60/L.34\", \"L\"], [\"entitled \\u201cAssistance to survivors of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, particularly orphans, widows and victims of sexual violence\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"Angola\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Armenia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Austria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Belgium\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Denmark\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Finland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"France\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Germany\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Greece\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Jamaica\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Mauritius\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Netherlands\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sudan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sweden\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Timor-Leste\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Rwanda\", \"UNPE\"], [\"April to July 1994\", \"DATE\"], [\"Up to one million\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"One million\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"more than 60\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Secondly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"1994\", \"DATE\"], [\"Rwanda\", \"UNPE\"], [\"1994\", \"DATE\"], [\"Rwanda\", \"UNPE\"], [\"four\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"last year\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolution 59/137\", \"R\"], [\"Two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 638,\n            'f': \"638\",\n        },\n\"A_60_PV.63-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 30,\n            'f': \"30\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999904632568359,\n            'f': \"0.9999904632568359\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"The President: In connection with draft resolution A/60/L.34 and the amendment thereto contained in document A/60/L.35, I would like to inform Members, after consultations, that action on these two documents is postponed to a later date to allow time for the review of their programme budget implications by the Fifth Committee.\",\n\"{'Action': 2.2706275615291815e-07, 'ActionObject': 5.201847557145811e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 7.453473216401107e-08, 'Body': 1.1865617377537774e-09, 'Clarification': 5.456414555737865e-07, 'Conclusion': 1.2149395267613272e-08, 'Election': 2.486848238447692e-08, 'General': 0.9999904632568359, 'Introduction': 6.183104250823135e-09, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.793637061098252e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 1.6021854065684238e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 1.2745158262106315e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 9.828356795082982e-09, 'MeetingStatus': 6.744551228621276e-08, 'OralStatement': 7.677489520574454e-06, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.3393144371320886e-08, 'RVRequested': 1.5430930144777477e-10, 'RVTaken': 4.620344107308938e-09, 'Session': 1.5169794309599638e-08, 'Sponsorship': 8.34469204846755e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.739514031764202e-09, 'Vote': 2.7842652627896314e-09, 'VotingIntention': 1.9908955550818064e-07}\",\n[[\"draft resolution A/60/L.34\", \"DR\"], [\"A/60/L.35\", \"L\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Fifth Committee\", \"C\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 639,\n            'f': \"639\",\n        },\n\"A_60_PV.63-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 31,\n            'f': \"31\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999427795410156,\n            'f': \"0.9999427795410156\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Thomson (United Kingdom): It is my pleasure, on behalf of the European Union (EU), to introduce draft resolutions A/60/L.36, which is entitled \\u201cAssistance to the Palestinian People\\u201d, and A/60/L.37, entitled \\u201cSafety and security of humanitarian personnel and protection of United Nations personnel\\u201d. With regard to draft resolution A/60/L.36, the European Union reiterates its commitment to the provision of assistance to the Palestinian people. Sustained donor support from the international community, working with the parties, is crucial if we are to see an improvement to the Palestinian economic and social infrastructure and to address the humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people. For its part, the European Union has undertaken to provide the \\u201cthird party\\u201d role described in the recent Agreement on Movement and Access issues reached between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The European Union will monitor the operations of the Rafah border crossing point and provide assistance to reinforce Palestinian border management capacities. Capacity-building, through training, equipment and technical assistance, is being taken forward through the European Community\\u2019s assistance to the Palestinian Authority. The European Union, alongside other Quartet members and international partners, is ready to assist the Palestinian Authority financially, technically and politically with their forthcoming multiparty elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council. We are prepared to send an observer mission to ensure that the elections are carried out in line with international principles for genuine democratic elections. The European Union will also continue to provide technical and economic aid to the Palestinian people and contribute to the strengthening of Palestinian institutions, with the aim of seeing a peaceful and democratic State governed by the rule of law. The European Union will continue to work with Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the international community to achieve the shared vision of a two-State solution set out in the road map. Both parties can count on the sustained support of the European Union in the ongoing effort to find a peaceful, durable and just settlement of the conflict. One country, in addition to the sponsors on the tabled draft resolution, has requested to be included as an additional sponsor of draft resolution A/60/L.36 on \\u201cAssistance to the Palestinian People\\u201d, and that country is Zambia. With regard to draft resolution A/60/L.37, it is important to recognize that humanitarian personnel and United Nations personnel provide an invaluable service to millions of civilians and vulnerable populations around the world, often in very difficult and challenging circumstances and often at great personal risk. The fact that such personnel have become increasingly exposed to security-related attacks and incidents, and that the perpetrators of such acts seemingly operate with impunity, clearly demonstrates why this issue demands our most urgent attention. The draft resolution highlights, in particular, the need to strengthen the normative framework for the safety and protection of humanitarian personnel and United Nations personnel. In this regard, the draft resolution calls on all States to consider becoming parties to, and to respect fully their obligations under, all relevant provisions of international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel and its Optional Protocol. The draft resolution also highlights the need to promote and enhance security management within the 3 United Nations system, as well as cooperation and coordination with other relevant organizations with a view to addressing mutual security concerns. In that regard, the draft resolution requests the Secretary- General to continue his good work, including by further enhancing security consciousness within the Organization and by further developing and implementing a strengthened and unified security management system for the United Nations. The informal consultations on the draft resolution were conducted in a positive manner, and we thank all interested delegations for their constructive engagement on the text.

It is a particular honour, Sir, to introduce this draft resolution under your presidency, as it draws upon the groundbreaking work for United Nations humanitarian assistance in which you once took the lead, which resulted in the often-referred-to resolution 46/182 of 1991. The draft before us today would lead to further progress in strengthening the coordination of the United Nations humanitarian system, which you helped to create in 1991. I should like to announce that, since the draft resolution was submitted to the Assembly, the following countries have become sponsors: Albania, Andorra, Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Canada, Chile, 4 Croatia, Hungary, Jamaica, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Nicaragua, Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, Samoa, Serbia and Montenegro, Slovakia, Slovenia, Thailand, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the United States of America. My delegation is grateful for the improvements made in the text by delegations through a series of informal consultations. We would like to thank the sponsors and other delegations for the good and constructive spirit of cooperation and partnership in which the consultations were held. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Ambassador of Luxembourg, Mr. Jean-Marc Hoscheit, for ably guiding our work. The draft resolution addresses both issues of important principle for humanitarian assistance and issues related to efforts to further strengthen international humanitarian response. With regard to the first category, I would like to emphasize that the draft reaffirms the principles of neutrality, humanity, impartiality and independence for the provision of humanitarian assistance and calls upon Governments and parties in complex humanitarian emergencies to cooperate fully with the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies and organizations and to ensure safe and unhindered access to affected populations. It expresses the General Assembly\\u2019s grave concern about violence deliberately directed against civilian populations in many emergency situations. It calls upon States to adopt preventive measures and effective responses to acts of violence against civilian populations and invites States to promote a culture of protection. It also expresses deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters and their horrific impact, which we have witnessed this year in the Indian Ocean region and more recently in Pakistan, the United States and Central America. In the second category, the main issue is the upgrading of the current Central Emergency Revolving Fund to a Central Emergency Response Fund \\u2014 a measure that will ensure a more predictable and timely response to humanitarian emergencies. Its objectives will be to promote early action and response aimed at reducing loss of life. It will enhance the response to time-critical requirements and will address situations in which humanitarian response is underfunded. The draft urges Member States \\u2014 and invites the private sector and all concerned individuals and institutions \\u2014 to consider making contributions to the Fund. Many generous pledges have already been made, totalling more than $107 million. And I am pleased to announce that today, the Swedish Government decided to contribute $40 million before the end of the year, so that the new Fund can become operational almost immediately after we take a decision here. Our collective aim should be to reach $500 million. The draft resolution also encourages the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to continue its efforts to strengthen the coordination of humanitarian assistance, and calls upon relevant humanitarian actors to strengthen humanitarian response capacity at all levels and coordination at the field level and to enhance transparency, performance and accountability. It also calls for improvement of the consolidated appeals process. In its final paragraph, the draft resolution requests the Secretary-General to report to the next session of the General Assembly, through the Economic and Social Council, on progress made in strengthening the coordination of humanitarian assistance of the United Nations. I would like to make two technical corrections to the text. At the end of operative paragraph 15, the comma between the words \\u201cState\\u201d and \\u201cas\\u201d should be deleted. In paragraph 17, the words \\u201cthat\\u201d and \\u201cis\\u201d after first word, \\u201cAffirms\\u201d, should be deleted; the paragraph would thus begin, \\u201cAffirms its role to provide\\u201d. My delegation and the other sponsors hope that the draft resolution contained in document A/60/L.38 will be adopted by consensus. \",\n\"{'Action': 4.12963709095493e-06, 'ActionObject': 1.8076709238812327e-05, 'AgendaStatus': 2.030420546361711e-06, 'Body': 7.136754476277929e-08, 'Clarification': 6.984234914853005e-06, 'Conclusion': 3.6057400620848057e-07, 'Election': 1.2401454796417966e-06, 'General': 0.9999301433563232, 'Introduction': 2.834473662005621e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 8.498670922563178e-07, 'MeetingLocation': 5.113922156851913e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 1.0166344566187036e-07, 'MeetingSegment': 2.9524533147196053e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 5.718189868275658e-07, 'OralStatement': 1.580849311721977e-05, 'PresidingOfficer': 4.5704709350502526e-07, 'RVRequested': 3.060365827423084e-08, 'RVTaken': 1.7187075229685433e-07, 'Session': 2.2364626772741758e-07, 'Sponsorship': 4.433636604517233e-06, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.3535387779484154e-06, 'Vote': 2.7840289362757176e-07, 'VotingIntention': 6.49709181743674e-06}\",\n[[\"Lid\\u00e9n\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Sweden\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"draft resolution A/60/L.38\", \"DR\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"resolution 46/182\", \"R\"], [\"1991\", \"DATE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"1991\", \"DATE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"Albania\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Andorra\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Australia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Belarus\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Brazil\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Canada\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Chile\", \"UNPE\"], [\"4\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Croatia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Hungary\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Jamaica\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Latvia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Liechtenstein\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Nicaragua\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Poland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Portugal\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the Republic of Korea\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Samoa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Serbia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Montenegro\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Slovakia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Slovenia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Thailand\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the United States of America\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Luxembourg\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Jean-Marc Hoscheit\", \"PERSON\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Pakistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"], [\"second\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"the end of the year\", \"DATE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"operative paragraph 15\", \"PARA\"], [\"\\u201cState\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"\\u201cas\\u201d should be deleted.

assistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief to development\\u201d. We are pleased to announce that in addition to the sponsors listed in the text \\u2014 Greece, Japan, the Russian Federation, Sweden and the United Kingdom \\u2014 the following countries have also joined as sponsors: Austria, Belarus, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Turkey. I wish to make a slight editorial correction to operative paragraph 10 of the English text. In line 7, delete the \\u201cs\\u201d in the word \\u201cnotes\\u201d, so that the relevant phrase reads \\u201ctakes note in this regard\\u201d. Natural disasters have always been a part of our reality; however, over the last year in particular, we have witnessed an increase in the frequency and scale of their occurrence, creating serious challenges for many countries suffering their adverse effects. Some of the consequences are long-lasting, especially in developing countries where they can seriously affect social and economic development. We are well aware that it may not be possible to totally eliminate the suffering caused by natural disasters, but we believe 5 that the international response should not only focus on immediate response but also on the long-term rehabilitation and developmental needs of States recovering from them. The draft resolution is based on the substance of previous texts on the same subject and attempts have been made to streamline and update it, based on recent developments. To begin with, the text, inter alia, reaffirms resolution 46/182 of 19 December 1991, which sets out the guiding principles for the strengthening of the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system. We also recall your outstanding role, Mr. President, in finalizing that resolution. The draft also emphasizes the role of the concerned State in minimizing the impact of a natural disaster, while also recognizing the importance of international cooperation in supporting the efforts of affected countries which may have limited capacities to fulfil that requirement. The Group of 77 and China also recognizes the necessity of coordination among respective partners, including affected States, regional and international organizations and civil society, throughout relief operations in medium and long-term rehabilitation and reconstruction, in a manner that reduces vulnerability to future natural hazards. The Group of 77 and China attaches importance to strengthening the efforts of countries, in particular developing countries, to enhance their capacities at all levels in order to prepare for and respond rapidly to natural disasters and to mitigate against their harmful effects. We are grateful to our partners for the constructive, compromising and friendly spirit in which our informal consultations on the draft took place. That has led to a reasonable outcome which we hope will be confirmed by the adoption of the text by consensus. Finally, I wish to acknowledge the outstanding work of the Indian delegation, in particular Ms. Ruchi Ghanashyam, in facilitating the text. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.310221432504477e-05, 'ActionObject':

Cuba considers with special attention the question of humanitarian assistance. If one lives in a region where climatic occurrences are increasingly frequent and each time leave behind greater destruction, then efforts in that area are essential to help mitigate the effects of those disasters. Moreover, we have extended our cooperation to our neighbours in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico to cope with the consequences of hurricanes that afflict the area. We believe, however, that the urgent needs of those caught in emergency situations should not be used to introduce notions that do not enjoy consensus among the members of the General Assembly, such as the so-called culture of protection referred to in operative paragraph 3. Furthermore, we would like to make it clear that operative paragraph 9 should not be understood as reinterpreting the agreement on the triennial comprehensive review of programmes, that there must be no attempt to expand the mandates and functions of United Nations officials present in particular countries and that the use of the terms \\u201cappropriate authority, resources and accountability\\u201d in this case refers strictly to the internal functioning of agencies in the field. Lastly, we sincerely hope that the expansion of the Central Emergency Revolving Fund will help tackle the funding requirements of humanitarian emergencies and that the resources that are distributed in an equitable manner are not earmarked in advance. Disbursement of funds should be carried out with respect for resolution 46/182, which sets out guiding principles for the provision of such humanitarian assistance. \",\n\"{'Action':

maintained longstanding support for humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people, and we are pleased to join the consensus on this resolution. We worked closely with the European Union, the United States and the Palestinians in order to be able to support this resolution and we are very happy that these issues can be affirmed in this context. I would like to emphasize that the drafting of this resolution was an example of a process that has fostered mutual respect and compromise. Unlike so many resolutions that target Israel in a biased, unbalanced manner, this resolution demonstrates that finding the middle ground is beneficial to our mutual endeavours, and we hope that such a mechanism will be replicated in future resolutions that address the Middle East. We believe that alleviating human suffering and enhancing the security, welfare and prosperity of all peoples in the Middle East are crucial components of successful peace initiatives, and the Israeli Government sets those goals as vital objectives. We have taken a number of steps to improve the humanitarian welfare of our Palestinian neighbours, such as working to the greatest extent possible in an environment marred by terrorism, to transport food, medicine, humanitarian assistance and other necessities to Palestinian areas. Israeli and Palestinian civilians have endured great difficulty and pain as a result of ongoing terrorist activity during the past five years. We believe that this 7 dangerous phenomenon continues to serve as the largest obstacle to improving the humanitarian situation of the Palestinian people. The fact that terrorist organizations freely operate within the Palestinian Authority serves as a direct threat to Israeli and Palestinian civilians and the facilitation of humanitarian assistance. Moreover, humanitarian efforts are all too often exploited by terrorist organizations. Several weeks ago, an important agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority regarding the border crossings was agreed upon. Currently, arrangements are being made to enable passage from Gaza to the West Bank. Unfortunately, Israel is receiving reports that known terrorists are freely crossing the Rafah border from Egypt into the Gaza Strip. The underlying cause of the violence in the region and the root of the humanitarian situation of the Palestinian people remains that unfortunate, yet preventable type of violence. Having said all that, and despite the horrific terror act in Netanya a few days ago, it should be emphasized that, as of 12 December 2005, 23,000 Palestinian employees \\u2014 7,000 from the Gaza Strip and 16,000 from the West Bank \\u2014 are approved to work in Israel in different sectors. In addition, 14,200 Palestinians who are international organization employees are crossing into Israel every day \\u2014 12,500 from the West Bank and 1,700 from the Gaza Strip. Israel believes that humanitarian assistance must be provided without selectivity or politicization. Israel\\u2019s decision to join consensus on this resolution should reflect that non-political good will. It should not be misconstrued as an endorsement of certain items within the text that contradict both the language expressed in the agreements of the parties and the underlying spirit of those agreements. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that civilians on both sides in the conflict endure pain. No one party has a monopoly on suffering, and we must ensure that both peoples live without violence or fear. The well-being of Palestinian and Israeli civilians alike will come about only through the mutual fulfilment of the obligations set out in the road map. The first phase of the road map requires the Palestinian Authority to put a stop to terrorism. Israel realizes that dismantling the terrorist infrastructure represents a difficult course of action. However, in order to advance towards peace, it is a necessary course of action. Israel 8 remains hopeful that, with responsible leadership and effective institutions, the dismantling of terrorist organizations and a commitment to peaceful coexistence, Israelis and Palestinians can work together to improve the humanitarian conditions of both our peoples. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.9395944406142007e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.1927906662378973e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 2.2355955309194542e-08,

As a result of this resolution, the upgraded Fund will become known as the Central Emergency Response Fund. The Assembly\\u2019s action today ensures that in the critical realm of humanitarian assistance, the United Nations will do more and do it sooner. As the States Members of the United Nations know better than anyone, the World Summit Outcome was a very ambitious document, and its follow-up is a daunting task. That was clear from the start, but it was also clear that a bold vision was necessary to prepare the United Nations for the twenty-first century. Today, thanks to the efforts of President Eliasson and of the entire membership, we celebrate our first success. The Emergency Fund has been a critical part of broad humanitarian reform. As outlined in my report \\\"In larger freedom\\\", such reform must provide for more timely and predictable funding, a strengthened humanitarian response capacity and better field coordination. For far too long, humanitarian assistance for disaster victims has remained a reactive process. Relief funds have been sought only after disaster has struck. Equally unacceptable is the unequal funding of different crises, with televised or strategically situated suffering receiving disproportionate attention. This has 9 meant that, all too often, as money trickled in, lives which could and should have been saved were lost. That is why I am especially encouraged by the broad General Assembly consensus in favour of this new stand-by fund. I hope that this support will translate into generous and immediate funding. If it does, it will allow more equitable distribution of relief, based on demonstrated need. It will also allow us to make emergency grants for rescue work in the aftermath of disasters. Quite simply, it will save lives. Already, at September's summit, donor nations have pledged $175 million in indicative support for the fund. Most of this money has been pledged by the European Union States. I thank them for their generosity and call on other Member States to contribute no less wholeheartedly. For our part, we in the Secretariat will consult with Member States and with other stakeholders to work out detailed administrative and management arrangements for the stand-by Fund. We promise to manage it with utmost transparency. We will be accountable, and we shall provide full public disclosure of all donations and expenditures. I think that, as the President has indicated, this will allow the Humanitarian Coordinator and all our humanitarian staff to respond much more quickly, and it will provide an essential means of doing so that they have lacked over the past year, as we have seen in one crisis after the other. I hope that more pieces of the summit follow-up puzzle will fall into place soon. In that regard, I look forward to next week's adoption by Member States of the revised draft resolution to establish the Peacebuilding Commission. In the meantime, let me congratulate you, Mr. President, and the Assembly on today's historic achievement. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.0173365438959081e-07, 'ActionObject': 4.643823103833711e-08,

for having supported this resolution. We should also like to thank the European Union for the inclusion of language on Palestinian children in this resolution, following the outcome of successful negotiations held during this session. We believe that such an inclusion of language on Palestinian children in a consensus resolution in the General Assembly sends a very strong message to the Palestinian people that the international community has recognized and addressed the detrimental effects of the Israeli occupation on the lives of Palestinian children. We believe also that this resolution will send a strong message of solidarity to the entire Palestinian population living under Israel\\u2019s 38-year-long brutal occupation and will indeed greatly assist in ameliorating their tragic plight. We look forward to the day when the Palestinian people will not have to depend on humanitarian assistance from the international community and will be able to live in their own independent State of Palestine, free from occupation, free from fear and State terrorism committed by Israel, the occupying power, and free from Israeli subjugation. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.171734780314182e-07,

representing the host country of the fifth International Conference of New or Restored Democracies (ICNRD), held in Ulaanbaatar in 2003. I speak here also in my capacity as current ICNRD Chair. The global momentum towards democratization, generated over the last three decades, during which many States, including my own, have embarked upon a process of democratization and many others have moved to restore their democratic roots, is truly remarkable in its scope and strength. Democracy today is firmly established as a universal value. This was most recently reaffirmed by the world leaders in the outcome document of the recent world summit. The movement of new or restored democracies, now global, was a product of the \\u201cthird wave of democratization\\u201d. Since its inception 17 years ago, the movement has, in its turn, played a prominent role in further promoting the process of democratization that has swept the world. The conferences of new or restored democracies have been a source of inspiration for many fledgling democracies in their struggle to build modern and functioning democratic societies based upon the principles of pluralism, respect for human rights, freedom of the press and democratic governance. The conferences have adopted important declarations and plans of action and have facilitated the exchange of views, experiences and lessons learnt among a wide array of new, restored and mature democracies. Declarations and plans, though important, are not enough. They must be followed by concrete actions or, to borrow the words of the Secretary-General in his report In larger freedom, \\u201ccommitments must be matched by performance\\u201d. My country, Mongolia, with assistance from the United Nations Development Programme, has therefore initiated, for the first time in the history of ICNRD, the pioneering experience of implementing practical follow-up activities to the outcome documents of the conference and catalysing a process of national adaptation and development of the international democracy agenda. Information on the innovations that Mongolia is piloting within the framework of the ICNRD-5 follow-up is contained in the Secretary-General\\u2019s report under this agenda item contained in document A/60/556. Allow me, nevertheless, to touch briefly upon some of these innovations. The Government of Mongolia has launched a pilot programme aimed at: first, formulating a national plan of action to consolidate democracy, and secondly, developing nationally-owned democratic governance indicators and preparing a country information note for Mongolia to measure its democratic performance, thus establishing the baselines for and benchmarking the democratic process in the country. This programme will facilitate the design and piloting of methodologies that other new or restored democracies can use in the preparation of their national action plans, country information notes and democracy indicators databases, as agreed under the Ulaanbaatar Plan of Action. In the context of developing democratic governance indicators and the national plan of action, Mongolia held its very first national state-of- democracy conference in June of this year. It brought together representatives of Government and civil society in an all-inclusive discussion of the quality of democracy in the country, its opportunities and challenges, and democratic solutions to crucial development issues Mongolia is now facing. Regional dialogues and consultations are now being planned to share Mongolia\\u2019s follow-up experiences with other new or restored democracies. Let me underline the importance of the growing need to assess progress in democratization. Improving the quality of democracy has become a political requirement in both the new or restored democracies and the mature democracies. Today, a general commitment to the norms of democracy is no longer enough. The development of democracy assessment methodologies and governance indicator exercises contributes to the systematic assessment of a country\\u2019s political life by the people in democracies and helps to answer the question: how democratic is a society in practice? How far have we progressed and what needs to be done to strengthen democracy in the future? So far, it is only in the Fifth ICNRD outcome documents that the Governments of new or restored democracies, along with their counterparts from mature democracies, 11 have expressed their willingness to develop nationally- owned democratic governance indicator databases to be better able to monitor their progress in democratic and social development over time. The development of such indicators in Mongolia will be the first attempt to produce a democracy assessment under the aegis of a governmental institution \\u2014 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in our case. Democracy is not an abstract value; it has a direct impact on the everyday lives of people. As our leaders stressed in the outcome document, democracy, development and respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing; therefore, the socio-economic dimension of democratization must be fully taken into account lest we put to risk the very credibility of that process. Accordingly, the democratic governance indicators in Mongolia will be specifically tailored to the requirements of Mongolian policymakers and responsive to priorities for reforms on the policy agenda from the point of view of the people, especially the poor and other disadvantaged groups. My delegation expresses its gratitude to the Secretary-General for his observation that significant progress has been made by Mongolia in ensuring a more effective follow-up to the recommendations adopted at the Fifth International Conference. I would like especially to note the group of friends of the Chair, which was established during the Fifth ICNRD with the purpose of assisting the Chair in the run-up to the next ICNRD, as an important innovation in that respect. We also agree with the Secretary-General on the necessity to further discuss the strengthening and broadening in scope and substance of the implementation process of the decisions taken at each Conference. The Secretary-General, in his report on support by the United Nations system of the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies, also touched upon the coordination between the International Conference of New or Restored Democracies and other global and regional intergovernmental democracy movements or organizations, including the Community of Democracies. Indeed, mutually supportive language has been adopted by both the ICNRD, with its all- inclusive composition, and the Community, with its more limited approach to membership. The 12 Ulaanbaatar Declaration of the Fifth ICNRD encouraged \\u201cthe two forums to work closely together in the pursuit of the common goal of developing and deepening democracy throughout the world\\u201d, and the Community of Democracies, at its third ministerial meeting held earlier this year in Santiago, took a commitment to \\u201cencourage cooperation with the ICNRD as an intergovernmental forum to promote and consolidate democratic governance in emerging and new democracies\\u201d. Mongolia, in its capacity as ICNRD Chair, a participating State of the Community of Democracies, and now a member of the Convening Group of the Community, has been proactive in its efforts to bring the two global intergovernmental movements aimed at democracy promotion and consolidation closer together. For example, Mongolia, as ICNRD Chair, participated earlier this year in the Community-led delegation to Georgia to share democratic experiences. Moreover, my delegation recently developed a non- paper on possible ways of bringing the two movements \\u2014 ICNRD and the Community of Democracies \\u2014 closer together and distributed it among the wide membership of the ICNRD, seeking their views. One of the first practical steps for the two movements, in our view, could be the participation of a Community of Democracies delegation in the regional activities on the exchange of experiences in follow-up to the Fifth ICNRD that Mongolia is planning to organize. In the same vein, Mongolia can only welcome the initiative of the Secretary-General to initiate a study on the comparative advantages, complementarity and desirable distribution of labour of various intergovernmental democracy movements, organizations and institutes, be they global or regional, and on how the United Nations system has worked and could further work with them in a mutually supportive way. Such a study, we hope, will be conducive to the global democracy promotion and consolidation effort by presenting concrete proposals and recommendations on streamlining and bringing more coherence into the actions of different stakeholders in that process, as well as the role and possible support of the United Nations system. Democratization is not an event; it is a process that takes years or even decades of relentless effort. Democracy is also a process that grows from within societies, but can and should be supported from outside. The United Nations, as an embodiment of the collective will of the world\\u2019s peoples, has a natural role to play in supporting democracy around the globe. It was reassuring to witness this year an important development in that particular field of United Nations activities \\u2014 the establishment of the Democracy Fund at the United Nations, which my country was among the first to welcome. The role of well-designed development and democracy-building assistance in the circumstances of an underdeveloped democracy cannot be overestimated. We must always bear in mind that there is no \\u201cone size fits all\\u201d democracy recipe, just as there are no absolutely similar recipes for development challenges. The best assistance is one that is sensitive to national specificities and also mindful of universal lessons that we have all accumulated in the past 30 years of the third wave of democratization. My delegation therefore welcomes the fact that the primary purpose of the Fund will be to support projects that consolidate and strengthen democratic institutions and facilitate democratic governance in new or restored democracies within the particular historical and cultural context of the country and region concerned, and looks forward to its early operationalization. Guided by Mongolia\\u2019s post-communist transition experience and its responsibility as Chair of the Fifth ICNRD, we believe that capacity-building and institution-building related to democratic governance and the rule of law, including aspects relevant to the implementation of international legal instruments on human rights and freedoms, should be the focus of the first-generation activities of the Democracy Fund. I would also like to emphasize that ICNRD, as an all- inclusive movement reflective of the composition of the United Nations membership, and with a serious substantive agenda on democratic governance and civil society, could also become a Democracy Fund partner in advancing the international democracy agenda. In conclusion, let me note that my delegation will introduce in the near future a draft resolution under this agenda item, the text of which we shall distribute to all delegations early next week. We sincerely hope that the draft resolution will be able to command the same or greater support and number of sponsorships from among the Member States than in previous years. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.5949548526350554e-07, 'ActionObject': 9.110349452612354e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 3.608360543694289e-07, 'Body': 2.5990292140676274e-09, 'Clarification': 1.6439058470041346e-07, 'Conclusion': 2.600935111729541e-08, 'Election': 2.3357661405043473e-07, 'General': 0.9999958276748657, 'Introduction': 1.0252612128169858e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.6252470419763085e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 9.320702787363189e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 1.6822840009922402e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 1.2561584981085616e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 6.823179887760489e-08, 'OralStatement': 2.1942156536169932e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.645030943744132e-08, 'RVRequested': 2.1488268941993738e-09, 'RVTaken': 7.487649611448433e-09, 'Session': 2.9518361088776146e-08, 'Sponsorship': 2.6468061520290576e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 5.089839305583155e-08, 'Vote': 4.263651476321684e-08, 'VotingIntention': 3.8136386137921363e-07}\",\n[[\"Choisuren\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2003\", \"DATE\"], [\"the last three decades\", \"DATE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"\\u201cthird wave of democratization\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"17 years ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"\\u201ccommitments must be matched by performance\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"A/60/556\", \"Symbol\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"secondly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"June of this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Today\", \"DATE\"], [\"11\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Fifth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"third\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"earlier this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"earlier this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Georgia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"One\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Fifth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"years\", \"DATE\"], [\"decades\", \"DATE\"], [\"this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"past 30\", \"PARA\"], [\"third\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Fifth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"early next week\", \"DATE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"previous years\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 728,\n            'f': \"728\",\n        },\n\"A_60_PV.63-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 120,\n            'f': \"120\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999234676361084,\n            'f': \"0.9999234676361084\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Thomson (United Kingdom): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the 25 countries of the European Union. A number of other countries have aligned themselves with this statement. They are Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Croatia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, Iceland, Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova. The European Union (EU) is committed to the implementation and promotion worldwide of democratic principles. The EU warmly welcomes the reaffirmation, contained in the outcome document of the world summit, that democracy is a universal value and that democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are all interdependent and mutually reinforcing. The promotion and protection of human rights are prerequisites for the existence of a democratic society, while democracy is the best means of ensuring the full realization and implementation of all human rights in the long term. Together, they help deliver genuine prosperity, progress and sustainable development. It is for this reason that the protection and advancement of democracy and the rule of law are among the top priorities for the international community. The European Union considers that international peace and security can best be served by the spread and consolidation of democracy. A well coordinated policy within the framework of the United Nations can help to achieve peaceful solutions to the conflicts that are threatening stability in different areas of the world and to enable democracy to take root where it has never existed before, or where it has been eliminated by war, dictatorship or the breakdown of civil society. It is equally necessary to shore up democratic institutions in countries in transition and to support democracy in all countries that have recently moved to a democratic system. We share the assessment of the Secretary-General in his report entitled \\u201cIn larger freedom\\u201d that \\u201cThe United Nations does more than any other single organization to promote and strengthen democratic institutions and practices around the world\\u201d (A/59/2005, para. 151). Because of the authority of the United Nations, the European Union considers the United Nations the most appropriate international framework within which 13 to work to enhance and promote democracy and human rights throughout the world. In particular, we would like to underline the role played by the High Commissioner for Human Rights and her focal point on democracy. The European Union welcomes the establishment of the United Nations Democracy Fund to take forward that vital work. We encourage the Secretary-General and the Fund to take stock of the experiences and activities of the United Nations and other international and regional organizations in that field and to cooperate closely with them in that task. Spreading good governance, supporting social and political reform, dealing with corruption and abuse of power, establishing the rule of law and protecting human rights are the best means of strengthening the international order. Accordingly, the European Union is committed to promoting democratization through its own cooperation programmes and in support of the United Nations. The representative of Mongolia has just referred to the fifth International Conference of New or Restored Democracies, held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, from 10 to 12 September 2003. The European Union noted that the outcome of that Conference proved there was growing support for strengthening democracy in all the regions of the world. A system of government which is based on the rule of law, democracy allows the free expression of political opinions through electoral and other participatory mechanisms, and guarantees the independence of the judiciary, freedom of the media and the promotion of human society, including the fight against exclusion and poverty. The participants in the Ulaanbaatar Conference endorsed those democratic principles while acknowledging that there was no one, ideal model for democracy. The European Union agrees. The Conference also addressed the many challenges to democracy, among which are poverty, international terrorism, transnational economic crime, HIV/AIDS and blatant disregard for human rights. It was agreed that while it is crucial to fight such threats effectively, that must be done without eroding human rights or resorting to repression. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.3112605756759876e-06, 'ActionObject': 2.306941723873024e-06, 'AgendaStatus': 2.1655598629877204e-06, 'Body': 3.6462203922837944e-08, 'Clarification': 8.65474532929511e-07, 'Conclusion': 2.5304865403086296e-07, 'Election': 2.544494236644823e-06, 'General': 0.9999234676361084, 'Introduction': 3.7123518268344924e-05, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.1937535166216549e-07, 'MeetingLocation': 4.746082993278833e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 1.6673764946517622e-07, 'MeetingSegment': 2.3875390979810618e-05, 'MeetingStatus': 3.1990543902793434e-07, 'OralStatement': 3.35293805164838e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.389376104223629e-07, 'RVRequested': 8.154604813626065e-08, 'RVTaken': 7.836853654907827e-08, 'Session': 1.7578150846020435e-07, 'Sponsorship': 2.4699542677808495e-07, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 9.109243706006964e-07, 'Vote': 4.664701123147097e-07, 'VotingIntention': 2.2869553504278883e-06}\",\n[[\"Thomson\", \"PERSON\"], [\"United Kingdom\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"25\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Bulgaria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Romania\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Turkey\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Croatia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Albania\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Bosnia and Herzegovina\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Serbia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Montenegro\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Iceland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Ukraine\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the Republic of Moldova\", \"UNPE\"], [\"European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"entitled \\u201cIn larger freedom\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"A/59/2005\", \"Symbol\"], [\"151\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"13\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"10 to 12 September 2003\", \"DATE\"], [\"European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"European Union\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 729,\n            'f': \"729\",\n        },\n\"A_60_PV.63-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 121,\n            'f': \"121\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999966621398926,\n            'f': \"0.9999966621398926\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Hachani (Tunisia), Vice-President, took the Chair.

Back in 1997, the member parliaments of the IPU developed and adopted a Universal Declaration on Democracy which has since guided much of our action, particularly as it relates to providing relevant assistance to young parliamentary institutions and building capacities therein. Parliament is, after all, the main institution of the State where the voices of all, majority and minorities, should be heard and their interests adequately articulated. It is in parliaments that the diverging interests of a nation compete and are, or should be, channelled towards the single objective of ensuring the common good, which inevitably includes the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. On the occasion of the fifth International Conference of New or Restored Democracies, held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, some two years ago, the IPU worked together with the Parliament of Mongolia in organizing a parliamentary forum aimed at looking at the role of parliaments in promoting democracy. Indeed, as the overall theme of the fifth Conference was democracy, good governance and civil society, the theme was reflected in the parliamentary forum and participants focused on how parliaments could strengthen democracy in partnership with civil society and how that role could be fulfilled in a coherent and coordinated manner at the national and international levels. The overarching focus of the debates was participation as a cornerstone of democracy. At the end of their deliberations, members of parliament who attended the event, numbering some 120 from over 50 countries, adopted a declaration that was subsequently endorsed by the IPU\\u2019s full membership. That declaration reiterates the core principles and values of participation, transparency and accountability and outlines the key ingredients of any democracy \\u2014 respect for human rights, including freedom of expression and association, the rule of law, partnership between men and women in political life and the existence of a vibrant civil society. The Declaration also contains a menu of proposed parliamentary action in support of democracy. It includes, but is not limited to, undertaking structural and legislative reforms at the national level to facilitate the greater participation of women in decision-making, fostering integrity and public trust and confidence in public institutions through more rigorous application of codes of conduct, and generally seeking more effective parliamentary oversight processes and structures. Also, there was a strong sense that democracy should not remain a theoretical concept. The forum spent a great deal of time debating ways in which democracy could be translated into concrete and practical reality. For instance, democracy should help to combat corruption through more transparency in the management of public affairs as a means of ensuring accountable, honest and effective government. The Ulaanbaatar parliamentarian forum was the first such event at the International Conference. It was thus an innovative and successful experience as evidenced by the agreement of the main Conference for it to become a permanent feature of the Conference. Therefore, on the occasion of the sixth International Conference next year in Doha, parliamentarians will provide an important opportunity to take stock of the progress achieved in the restoration, establishment and consolidation of democratic processes at the national level \\u2014 for example, more countries holding free elections, establishing representative institutions, including parliaments, and allowing for the plurality of expression. It will also allow for a review of the areas where more efforts will need to be deployed, including through more balanced representation of men and women in political processes. For its part, the IPU has been following up on a number of the recommendations of the forum. It is currently in the process of updating its standards in the area of elections. It has recently published a compendium of expert papers on developments in the electoral field, including innovative mechanisms by which to judge elections. Early next year, it expects to publish an updated version of its publication Free and Fair Elections: International Law and Practice. That publication was first issued 10 years ago, and contains the text of the Declaration on Criteria for Free and Fair Elections, which has been used worldwide as a guide for those involved in organizing and monitoring elections. Another exercise on which the IPU has embarked as a direct follow-up to the parliamentarians\\u2019 forum in Ulaanbaatar is a project to establish a framework for democracy from the parliamentary perspective. That project is identifying good practices by parliaments in promoting democracy, with a specific focus on representation at both the national and international levels. The resulting framework should serve as a guide for encouraging the promotion by parliaments of processes and mechanisms that enhance democracy. That project is expected to be concluded by the middle of 2006 and will serve as an important contribution to the sixth International Conference of New or Restored Democracies and the related parliamentarians\\u2019 forum, to be held in Doha, Qatar, in November 2006. Last but not least, in addition to those efforts the IPU has continued its work to assist in strengthening capacities in parliaments in emerging democracies such as Afghanistan, Burundi, Equatorial Guinea, Timor- Leste, Albania and \\u2014 hopefully very soon \\u2014 Iraq. In conclusion, I would like to mention that the IPU welcomes the initiative of the Secretary-General to call for a study on the comparative advantages, complementarity and desirable distribution of labour of various intergovernmental and inter-State democracy movements, organizations and institutes, whether global or regional, and on how the United Nations system has worked and could further work with them in a mutually supportive way. The IPU stand ready to be part of that process and looks forward to a more in- depth discussion on this issue next year in Doha. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.6032706184887502e-07, 'ActionObject':

First, I would like to express my delegation\\u2019s satisfaction with the Secretary-General\\u2019s report entitled \\u201cSport for development and peace: strengthening the partnerships\\u201d (A/65/270). We welcome the actions undertaken by the United Nations system, especially the Office of Sport for Development and Peace. I would also like to stress how much my delegation values the continuing and unstinting efforts of Mr. Wilfried Lemke, the Secretary-General\\u2019s Special Adviser on Sport for Development and Peace. We particularly applaud his activities in C\\u00f4te d\\u2019Ivoire in cooperation with the United Nations Operation in that country and the role he has played on behalf of the United Nations vis-\\u00e0-vis the authorities of that friendly country, to which a Tunisian contingent has been sent as part of the United Nations peacekeeping forces there. We wish Mr. Lemke every success in his noble endeavour and assure him of our full support for his efforts to ensure the success of programmes aimed at promoting sport around the world. Tunisia, which supported the original idea of the International Year for Sport and Physical Education in 2005 (resolution 58/5), remains determined to continue its efforts to make sport, through its ability to promote communication and rapprochement, become a driving force for integrating development, at both the national and the international levels, and a means of promoting solidarity, tolerance and cultural and human diversity. Today, sport is part and parcel of the United Nations and an effective tool that should be borne in mind as we consider the issues confronting this Organization, as was pointed out during the consultations on the Outcome Document (resolution 65/1) of the Summit on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), whose paragraph 67 deals with the role that sport can play in facilitating the implementation of the MDGs. We thank the Secretary-General for formulating the Action Plan in his report to the sixty-first session (A/61/373), and we welcome the fact that that has been continued in the current report, with proposed improvements and adjustments that will undoubtedly only strengthen the effectiveness of sport as a tool for promoting peace, development, education and health. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate South Africa on its successful holding of the last World Cup, and Singapore on the success of the first Youth Olympics. Those events clearly demonstrated the unifying nature of sport and the enthusiasm it can generate for friendship and solidarity among athletes and fans, irrespective of their origins, loyalties and beliefs. Given sport\\u2019s noble nature and the vital contribution it can make to the emergence of younger generations in good physical and mental health, Tunisia takes this opportunity to call on Member States to take all necessary measures to confront the dangers of doping, which threatens both the health of athletes and the image and credibility of sporting events. We welcome the growing number of Member States that have signed the International Convention against Doping in Sport, which is the first global instrument in the fight against that scourge, adopted at the thirty-third session of the UNESCO General Conference in 2005. Based on our interest in continuing that momentum and making sport a means of promoting universal principles in the service of future generations, I have the honour to introduce draft resolution A/65/L.4 entitled \\u201cSport as a means to promote education, health, development and peace\\u201d, on behalf of Monaco, Tunisia, the members of the Group of Friends of Sport for Development and Peace and on behalf of the other sponsors, whose names are listed in the document. I would like to point out that, since the publication of that document, the following Member States have joined the list of sponsors, namely, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, Central African Republic, Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, Lithuania, Montenegro, Poland, Portugal, San Marino, Spain, Thailand and Zambia. The draft resolution is the outcome of consultations, both with a large number of Member States and with United Nations bodies, to whom we extend our sincere thanks and gratitude for the interest accorded to the draft text. The draft resolution encourages all stakeholders to cooperate with the Special Adviser to the Secretary- General in order to make more widely known the importance of including sport in development programmes, while calling on Member States to appoint focal points responsible for sport for development and peace and to establish innovative partnerships with the United Nations Office on Sport for Development and Peace. Here, I would like to express the hope that the draft resolution will enjoy the support of all General Assembly Member States, which would send a strong message to all those acting in the name of the noble 2 practice of sport and provide great encouragement to all athletes. \",\n\"{'Action': 4.2760225937854557e-07, 'ActionObject': 8.757643286116945e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 1.3933893114881357e-06, 'Body': 2.2277999889297462e-08, 'Clarification': 7.601345828334161e-07, 'Conclusion': 3.016734240190999e-07, 'Election': 7.612736112605489e-07, 'General': 0.9999685287475586, 'Introduction': 1.0570491213002242e-05, 'MeetingDateTime': 9.137542633652629e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 2.731882204898284e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 7.958180248124336e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 1.1385150173737202e-05, 'MeetingStatus': 1.6473214259349334e-07, 'OralStatement': 7.646744961675722e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.830157145832345e-07, 'RVRequested': 3.1328635685667905e-08, 'RVTaken': 5.756703913561978e-08, 'Session': 1.216599230247084e-07, 'Sponsorship': 3.07260449972091e-07, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.580254031021468e-07, 'Vote': 1.7821542996898643e-07, 'VotingIntention': 2.3975894691830035e-06}\",\n[[\"Jomaa\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Tunisia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"entitled \\u201cSport for development and peace: strengthening the partnerships\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"A/65/270\", \"Symbol\"], [\"Wilfried Lemke\", \"PERSON\"], [\"C\\u00f4te d\\u2019Ivoire\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Lemke\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Tunisia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2005\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolution 58/5\", \"R\"], [\"Today\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolution 65/1\", \"R\"], [\"paragraph 67\", \"PARA\"], [\"A/61/373\", \"Symbol\"], [\"South Africa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Singapore\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Tunisia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"2005\", \"DATE\"], [\"draft resolution A/65/L.4\", \"DR\"], [\"entitled \\u201cSport as a means to promote education, health, development and peace\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Monaco\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Tunisia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Belgium\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Bosnia and Herzegovina\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Bulgaria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Canada\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Central African Republic\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Croatia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Cyprus\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Finland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Lithuania\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Montenegro\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Poland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Portugal\", \"UNPE\"], [\"San Marino\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Spain\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Thailand\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Zambia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"2\", \"CARDINAL\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 746,\n            'f': \"746\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 12,\n            'f': \"12\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999978542327881,\n            'f': \"0.9999978542327881\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Quint\\u00e3es (Brazil): At the very outset, the Brazilian delegation would like to welcome draft resolution A/65/L.4, submitted by the delegations of Monaco and Tunisia and entitled \\u201cSports as a means to promote education, health, development and peace\\u201d. That effort seems to be in close harmony with the main initiatives and programmes undertaken by Member States and international organizations to promote that objective in an integrated manner that is consistent with accomplishments in other social fields. The practice of sports is deeply rooted in Brazilian society. Accordingly, sport in Brazil is traditionally regarded as instrumental in forging good standards of citizenship, thereby playing a very special role in maintaining a healthy social fabric. Furthermore, it cannot be overstressed that access to sport constitutes a fundamental social right that is enshrined in our Constitution. In that regard, the Brazilian Government firmly believes in the potential of sport as an important factor in social inclusiveness and development, as well as a tool for fostering role model values and a solid upbringing for our children and youth. Our Government\\u2019s policy is to consider sport as part of a broader context that also encompasses the fields of education and health. We believe that dealing with sport in a socially integrated and holistic way promotes peace and development. That view stems from the collective awareness that sport alone is not capable of solving complex social and economic challenges and that it cannot, by itself, ensure peace and mutual cooperation. Bearing that in mind, the Brazilian Government has adopted a series of public policies focused on promoting citizenship, education and health through sports. Thus, several governmental initiatives are been launched in Brazil with a focus on multi-stakeholder partnerships with representative institutions in our society. For instance, we have started a programme that employs over 12,000 inmates from State prisons to manufacture sports equipment, whose output is then used in other educational sports programmes carried out by the Brazilian Government. The so-called Second Half programme fosters, in turn, sports activities for children and youngsters enrolled in public schools, and it already has more than 1 million participants. Likewise, pursuant to the recommendations of draft resolution A/65/L.4, Brazil is currently developing international sports cooperation projects in partnership with other developing countries, namely, Benin, Botswana, Kenya, Palestine, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. We remain open not only to increasing and expanding the scope of such programmes with other countries, but also to launching initiatives in cooperation with United Nations agencies and programmes. We feel that an exciting sports-centred decade has just begun. Over the next six years, Brazil will host three mega-sporting events: the fifth World Military Games in 2011, the World Cup of the F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration internationale de football association in 2014, and the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2016. During this decade, sports will be at the top of the Brazilian social, political and economic agenda. The decision to host those mega-events is very much consistent with the priority accorded to the promotion of sustainable development and social inclusiveness. Hence, the Brazilian Government remains committed to fostering and adopting public policies, convinced that hosting such events will help generate more jobs and improve our national infrastructure and increase opportunities for Brazilian youth. Brazil also hopes that those mega-events will provide an opportunity for us to share experience in promoting sports as a means to achieve social inclusiveness and to enhance the development of partnerships with other nations, especially developing countries. For all those reasons, it is with the utmost satisfaction that Brazil renews its support for and sponsorship of the draft resolution on sport as a means to promote education, health, development and peace. \",\n\"{'Action': 9.141123058498124e-08, 'ActionObject': 7.195424700512376e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 1.7394779661117354e-07, 'Body': 1.1672611766044838e-09, 'Clarification': 1.278612131727641e-07, 'Conclusion': 1.3893604489112477e-08, 'Election': 2.396044749275461e-07, 'General': 0.9999978542327881, 'Introduction': 7.686128924433433e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.0657511257127226e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 3.673360637890255e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 7.315677841290835e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 2.0879707562926342e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 4.497433891970104e-08, 'OralStatement': 6.249609896258335e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.3983205582899245e-08, 'RVRequested': 1.5606935743761596e-09, 'RVTaken': 3.105455892438158e-09, 'Session': 1.8341832941359826e-08, 'Sponsorship': 1.5676127063102285e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.192673065337658e-08, 'Vote': 6.456756551642684e-08, 'VotingIntention': 1.731794299075773e-07}\",\n[[\"Quint\\u00e3es\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Brazil\", \"UNPE\"], [\"draft resolution A/65/L.4\", \"DR\"], [\"Monaco\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Tunisia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"entitled \\u201cSports as a means to promote education, health, development and peace\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"Brazil\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Brazil\", \"UNPE\"], [\"12,000\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Second\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"more than 1 million\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"draft resolution A/65/L.4\", \"DR\"], [\"Brazil\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Benin\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Botswana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kenya\", \"UNPE\"], [\"South Africa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Uganda\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Zambia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the next six years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Brazil\", \"UNPE\"], [\"three\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"fifth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"2011\", \"DATE\"], [\"2014\", \"DATE\"], [\"2016\", \"DATE\"], [\"this decade\", \"DATE\"], [\"Brazil\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Brazil\", \"UNPE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 747,\n            'f': \"747\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 13,\n            'f': \"13\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999808073043823,\n            'f': \"0.9999808073043823\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): At the outset, on behalf of the Republic of Kazakhstan, I wish to express our warm appreciation to Mr. Wilfried Lemke, Special Adviser to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on Sport for Development and Peace, and his Office for their record of commendable activities over the past year. My Government would also like to convey special gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, as the driving force behind that thrust, for his report entitled \\u201cSport for development and peace: strengthening the partnerships\\u201d (A/65/270). The report presents a comprehensive overview of how sport has been used to achieve development and peace at the national, regional and international levels. It also highlights the innovative use of sport in carrying forward the messages of the United Nations at major global games and sporting events, such as during the 2010 World Cup of the F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration internationale de football (FIFA) in South Africa. That was the first FIFA championship hosted on the African continent, indeed in a developing country, which gave momentum to the political, socio-economic and development goals of the region through the convening power of sports. In addition, the Secretary- General\\u2019s appeal to all Member States to adhere to the Olympic Truce, called for in the universally accepted resolution 64/4, has been effective in upholding peace, security and human dignity, as demonstrated during the XXI Olympic Winter Games and the X Paralympic Winter Games, in Vancouver, Canada, in February and March 2010. The Action Plan on Sport for Development and Peace should be an integral component of all national and international policies and agendas aimed at promoting peace and development. My country would therefore like to underscore the decisive role of the Sport for Development and Peace International Working Group in providing consultations and technical assistance to Member States with a view to making sport a vehicle for advancing national measures for security, human rights, equality and the betterment of humankind. Kazakhstan took special steps to align itself with the work of the United Nations by developing a large- scale programme of physical training and sports throughout the country, accessible to all age groups and levels of the population, for the period from 2007 to 2011. The 2008 national legislation makes it obligatory for the Government to create sports facilities and infrastructure, provide training for national teams and protect the legal right of each citizen to have equal access to those possibilities. Kazakhstan has already set in place a complex goal-oriented agenda and programme for the athletes competing in the XXX Olympic Summer Games in London in 2012. Furthermore, Kazakhstan will host the seventh Asian Winter Games, Asiada 2011, and intensive projects are under way to ensure that the stated objectives and targets are reached in time. The 3 programme will comprise 11 different types of sport and 69 sets of tournaments, with an estimated total of 10,000 accredited participants and approximately 1,400 athletes. The Ministry of Tourism and Sport of the Republic of Kazakhstan, together with leading world architects, has developed a massive project for constructing numerous sports stadiums, arenas and related facilities of the highest standards in quality, meeting international norms of durability and safety. Currently, some 80 per cent of construction work is under way, and it is anticipated that all facilities in Astana will be completed by 25 October 2010 and in Almaty by the end of this year. Asiada 2011 will be the first Winter Games of the continent, and my Government is striving to make them a memorable event for the region. The preliminarily expenditure for constructing facilities and for other preparations is to the tune of $1 billion. Kazakhstan strictly complies with the regulations of the International Convention against Doping in Sport and has ratified it. We would especially like to stress the effectiveness of the use of sport as a tool for development and peace, as demonstrated during the XXI Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver. Kazakhstan will continue to do its utmost towards that objective in its national and regional activities and also at the international level. Inspired by the ideals of the Paralympic Games, Kazakhstan, like all other countries, pays increasing attention to sports for the personal development and rehabilitation of persons with disabilities by creating the optimal conditions for their participation. I am pleased to report that Kazakhstan will soon ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol. Kazakhstan also undertakes measures for enhancing excellence in professional and competitive sports and, at the same time, developing leisure sporting activities for the wider community with varied interests. The focus is also on using sport for physical fitness and inculcating the values of a healthy lifestyle in the population. Legislation has been adopted to support the effective creation and functioning of sport- oriented non-governmental organizations to partner with the Government to promote education, physical and mental health and well-being. A very significant advantage of sport is its effectiveness in inspiring youth with the positive ideals of national and community service, as well as promoting the values of equity, tolerance, respect for rules, fair play, hard work, healthy competition and good character. Kazakhstan focuses on all those elements. My delegation considers that the accelerated dynamism and outreach seen in United Nations efforts to integrate sport for development and peace, under the leadership of the Secretary-General, are most encouraging. We call for the further engagement of all stakeholders \\u2014 Governments, parliamentarians, religious leaders, academia, the business sector, media, civil society and especially youth groups \\u2014 to work for this new vision of sport. Through collective multilateral action, sport can become one of the most powerful means to accelerate the achievement of broader development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. Sport is only a means, yet an important one, to strengthen our collective multilateral enterprise in combating climate change, drugs and illicit trafficking in all forms and in promoting environmental conservation and sustainable development, human rights and gender equality, as well as interreligious and cultural dialogue, to mention a few issues, through raising awareness and mobilizing action on them. We need to fully seize this moment to utilize sport in propelling action to support the United Nations, as well as the individual efforts of Member States for their agendas of development and peace. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.178618660446773e-07, 'ActionObject': 1.424391484761145e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 9.903467343974626e-07, 'Body': 5.677182279839599e-09, 'Clarification': 2.8083113079446775e-07, 'Conclusion': 9.632934450110042e-08, 'Election': 3.492320956866024e-07, 'General': 0.9999808073043823, 'Introduction': 1.129692554968642e-05, 'MeetingDateTime': 3.620020194716744e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 1.57468605266331e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 3.981255147778029e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 4.3475265556480736e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 8.775872828437059e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.0786316551048003e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.1777893860198674e-07, 'RVRequested': 1.2910114755015911e-08, 'RVTaken': 1.2827717554841911e-08, 'Session': 3.246785595933943e-08, 'Sponsorship': 3.2067319466477784e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.5035220712888986e-07, 'Vote': 1.0795228178039906e-07, 'VotingIntention': 8.39037170408119e-07}\",\n[[\"Aitimova\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"the Republic of Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Wilfried Lemke\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the past year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Ban Ki-moon\", \"PERSON\"], [\"entitled \\u201cSport for development and peace: strengthening the partnerships\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"A/65/270\", \"Symbol\"], [\"South Africa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"resolution 64/4\", \"R\"], [\"Canada\", \"UNPE\"], [\"February and March 2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2007 to 2011\", \"DATE\"], [\"2008\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2012\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"seventh\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"3\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"comprise 11\", \"PARA\"], [\"69\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"10,000\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"approximately 1,400\", \"PARA\"], [\"the Republic of Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"25 October 2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"the end of this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 748,\n            'f': \"748\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 14,\n            'f': \"14\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999979734420776,\n            'f': \"0.9999979734420776\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Ben\\u00edtez Vers\\u00f3n (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): The San Francisco Charter established the bases of a new system of international relations, conceived to avoid repetition of the terrible consequences of the two world wars of the twentieth century. The main purpose, inscribed in the first paragraph of the Charter, is to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to create a democratic and equitable international order based on respect for the dignity of all human beings equally. More than six decades after the creation of the United Nations, the vast majority of the world suffers the consequences of the profoundly unjust and unsustainable prevailing international order. We are witness to a sad economic and social panorama, characterized by the combination of the economic and financial crisis, the food and energy crisis and the 4 negative impact of climate change, which endangers the human species. Now more than ever, it is our duty to promote a peaceful international environment through solidarity, cooperation and multilateralism. Sport constitutes a significant aspect of development at both the national and the international levels. Sport strengthens solidarity and friendship among peoples as essential elements in the promotion of peace, development and cooperation among nations. Since the triumph of the Cuban revolution in 1959, sport in our country has not been an exclusive pastime and became a right for all our people. As a result, Cuba has achieved significant success in regional and international sport competitions. We have fostered a pedagogical system that includes physical education as an integral part of all stages of training the human being. We work to provide sport training for our children from an early age. Likewise, we oppose athletic activities that have money as their only reward. We also denounce the talent drain in sports, which developing countries are victims of. Cuba has suffered the consequences of that unacceptable practice. For years, the Cuban sports movement, led by the Cuban Olympic Committee and the National Institute of Sports, Physical Education and Recreation has selflessly collaborated with various countries of the South. We have sent to those countries technicians, professors and trainers who in a modest way teach new sport training methods, thus contributing to improving sport results and people\\u2019s participation in sport and developing bonds of brotherhood and friendship between peoples. Likewise, we have strengthened international cooperation by making our Institute of Sports Medicine and the National Anti-doping Laboratory available to other countries, with the purpose of contributing to the fight against the scourge of drugs, which corrupt athletes and impede fair play. Cuba created the International School of Physical Education and Sport, dedicated to training professionals from different countries. Its central value is solidarity. The countries of the South also deserve to host the Olympic Games, which are a forum for brotherhood and solidarity. We are certain that the 2016 Olympics Games, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, will be a success for the entire South. If we promote international solidarity, including through the Olympic ideal, all the weapons created by this civilization will be rendered superfluous. Let us promote and sow peace and development through sport, and we will have a better world. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.6887495846162892e-08, 'ActionObject': 2.3784000546811512e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 2.0181340687486227e-07, 'Body': 4.510565809745515e-10, 'Clarification': 3.357967059969269e-08, 'Conclusion': 8.207655000092018e-09, 'Election': 1.3239512952623045e-07, 'General': 0.9999979734420776, 'Introduction': 6.533581426992896e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 6.316790202021139e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 1.8648524502395958e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 7.029236304134656e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 8.28500105853891e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 1.3420017985765753e-08, 'OralStatement': 2.180532732154461e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 8.158101749700108e-09, 'RVRequested': 1.1957674850293643e-09, 'RVTaken': 1.334382160322889e-09, 'Session': 6.370062699545542e-09, 'Sponsorship': 3.2391134219267315e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 7.772067434075325e-09, 'Vote': 1.4751128318835072e-08, 'VotingIntention': 6.611652736410178e-08}\",\n[[\"Ben\\u00edtez Vers\\u00f3n\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Cuba\", \"UNPE\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the twentieth century\", \"DATE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"More than six decades\", \"DATE\"], [\"4\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"1959\", \"DATE\"], [\"Cuba\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Cuba\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Recreation\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Cuba\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Brazil\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 749,\n            'f': \"749\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 15,\n            'f': \"15\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999852180480957,\n            'f': \"0.9999852180480957\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Al Mujaini (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): Allow me at the outset, Mr. President, to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I wish you every success in your task so that we can achieve our desired objectives. Sport is an important means of strengthening social cohesion and the ideals of peace, brotherhood, solidarity, justice, non-violence and tolerance. It facilitates the resolution of problems in post-crisis times. Sport can bring people together and serve as a forum for development, peace and social development. It is a recognized means of reinforcing peace among various countries of the world. It transcends borders and social classes and plays an important role in social integration and economic development in the political, cultural and geographical fields. The participation of youth in sport is an important element for achieving peace and development in the world, not to mention its cultural and intellectual contributions to different issues. It enables youth to be uniquely creative in developing their societies. In reinforcing their participation in sport, we must provide youth with the necessary means and resources for them to achieve their vision of and aspiration to a prosperous homeland. That will help them build their capacities and skills so that they can be positively integrated in society and achieve the objectives of peace and development and so that they can spread their vision and goals and increase their chances of creative participation within their societies. The General Assembly recognized this in resolutions 58/5, 59/10, 60/9 and in its proclamation of 2005 as the International Year for Sport and Physical Education, seeking to encourage sport as a means of promoting education, health, development and peace. Also, the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) states that sport could foster peace and development. 5 Sport and physical education could provide opportunities for solidarity and cooperation that would foster tolerance and a culture of peace and equality between genders. It can also provide for the needs of disabled persons, achieve dialogue among civilizations and foster social cohesion and concord. We need a joint framework within the United Nations to encourage sport as a means to reinforce education, health, development and peace. To that end, we must expand the mandate of the Group of Friends of Sport for Development and Peace, along with the United Nations communications team that would set up a practical approach, strategies, policies and common programmes in order to increase awareness and cooperative action within the United Nations and with other partners from outside the Organization. The Government of my country, under the sponsorship of His Excellency the Sultan of Oman, provides to Omani citizens every means to carry out their tasks in the fields of development and construction, especially since the young of both sexes constitute the largest percentage of our society. In 2004, we established a Ministry of Sport that prepares youth in the field of sport and that cooperates with other Government bodies all over the country. That enhances sport in Oman in many domains and helps to utilize the potential of youth and their ability to communicate with other friendly and sisterly countries. Our Ministry, on the basis of that noble objective, has a vision of establishing a sports system that ensures optimal use of technical, human and material resources in the field of competitive sport and sport for all. The Ministry also seeks to send a clear message that promises quality sport services and facilities through the activation of good organization, communications, marketing and building partnerships with relevant institutions. As we seek to strengthen relations among various peoples, we will host the second Asian Beach Games in December 2010, to be sponsored by the Olympic Council of Asia. It will include many sports activities with a large number of Asian countries participating in various capacities. \",\n\"{'Action': 4.6031195211071463e-07, 'ActionObject': 2.2375010644282156e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 1.0970721859848709e-06, 'Body': 1.0720806464803445e-08, 'Clarification': 3.1992394156077353e-07, 'Conclusion': 5.459542506969228e-08, 'Election': 9.208157507600845e-07, 'General': 0.9999852180480957, 'Introduction': 2.5812948933889857e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 4.736136460792295e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 1.985134900905905e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 5.4647934177864954e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 7.16929889676976e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 1.468696524398183e-07, 'OralStatement': 4.3142622985214985e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.0655860194219713e-07, 'RVRequested': 8.279751995132756e-09, 'RVTaken': 2.2928773546482262e-08, 'Session': 9.196129013844256e-08, 'Sponsorship': 4.9848132732677186e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.426075044719255e-07, 'Vote': 7.842077565101135e-08, 'VotingIntention': 6.194634920575481e-07}\",\n[[\"Al Mujaini\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Oman\", \"UNPE\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"sixty-fifth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"resolutions 58/5\", \"R\"], [\"59/10\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2005\", \"DATE\"], [\"2005\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolution 60/1\", \"R\"], [\"5\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Oman\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2004\", \"DATE\"], [\"Oman\", \"UNPE\"], [\"second\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"December 2010\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 750,\n            'f': \"750\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 16,\n            'f': \"16\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999985694885254,\n            'f': \"0.9999985694885254\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Fulp (United States of America): The United States delegation supports promoting the use of sport to advance peace and development. My delegation appreciates the potential of sport to contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. 6 Sport can foster development and peace, can build an atmosphere of tolerance and understanding, and can serve as a tool for education. Well-planned sporting programmes promote cooperation, solidarity, social inclusion and health among all of those engaged. Throughout history, sport has played an important role in the social, political and economic lives of peoples and nations. Sport is a shared cultural passion that can bring people together across the divisions of region, race and religion. One of the great things about sport is that it reminds us of what humanity has in common \\u2014 not what may drive us apart. The United States recognizes the value of sport in that way and has created an office called SportsUnited within the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs at the Department of State. It is dedicated to international sport programming designed to work at the grass-roots level. Its purpose it to aid foreign youth in discovering how success in athletics can be translated into the development of life skills and achievement in the classroom. SportsUnited provides for those foreign youth exposure to American life and culture. It also provides American youth interacting with them the opportunity to learn about foreign cultures and the challenges young people from other countries face today. Since 2002, the Department of State has funded and organized sports programmes in more than 80 countries in all regions of the world. Those programmes have featured activities in over 25 sports and areas such as disability sports, managing sports centres, recreational sports and sports management. There is so much from the world of sport to imagine and apply towards improving lives together, whether across oceans, in neighbourhoods or in our homes. For example, First Lady Michelle Obama\\u2019s 2010 \\u201cLet\\u2019s Move!\\u201d campaign against childhood obesity is making a difference in the lives of children and families. It encourages physical activity for youth and is improving the quality and availability of physical education in schools. And we are proud to note that \\u201cLet\\u2019s Move!\\u201d is based on an exemplary partnership between the public and private sectors that has underpinned its success. Sport has the power to bring us together and to build stronger societies. One critically important way that our societies improve is through integrating women and girls fully, and sport has proven powerful in that regard. Recently, United States Permanent Representative Susan Rice was recognized by the Women\\u2019s National Basketball Association with its Inspiration Award. Having been an athlete in school, she reminded the gathering: \\u201cOur daughters need role models who can inspire them to play to the best of their abilities, to compete to the limits of their strength, and to win on their own terms \\u2026 Sports are just simply too important to be left to the boys. Determination and drive are habits girls must learn early on and use for a lifetime. These really are the fundamentals \\u2014 the skills I learned on the court \\u2014 long before I ever sat at a negotiating table.\\u201d Another way that sport contributes to our society is its inherent lesson of fair play. Perhaps the biggest threat to that is the destructive practice of doping in sport. I am pleased to note, in that regard, that in 2008 the United States signed an instrument of ratification on the International Convention against Doping in Sport, at the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. That ratification demonstrated our long-standing commitment to the development of international anti-doping controls and our promise to apply and facilitate the application of appropriate anti-doping controls during competitions held in the United States. My delegation appreciates the report of the Secretary-General for today\\u2019s debate (A/65/270). It updates us usefully on progress regarding Sport for Development and Peace, International Working Group policy recommendations, the functioning of the United Nations Office of Sport for Development and Peace, the Trust Fund for Sport for Development and Peace, and the Action Plan on Sport for Development and Peace. Furthermore, the United States is pleased to offer its support for today\\u2019s draft resolution, \\u201cSport as a means to promote education, health, development and peace\\u201d (A/65/L.4), under agenda item 11, \\u201cSport for peace and development\\u201d. Athletes and sports accomplishments provide powerful examples in our globalized society, more and more each year. As I have described, the United States has made sport part of its global outreach efforts for decades. That commitment goes all the way to the top. President Obama recently invited young Russian basketball players \\u2014 boys and girls \\u2014 to Washington on a SportsUnited sports visitor programme. He invited them to the White House court to shoot some hoops. Diplomacy these days is not only about official meetings in conference rooms; it is also about people- to-people exchanges that break down barriers and build up goodwill. Sport truly is a global language. Sport teaches us how to work in teams. Sport builds discipline and confidence. Sport builds upon those values and strengths in our work here at the United Nations, promoting development and peace through sport. \",\n\"{'Action': 4.351564086846338e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.1797184562567509e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 1.1636143426585477e-07, 'Body': 5.810992798060965e-10, 'Clarification': 3.77618647462441e-08, 'Conclusion': 6.156569920534594e-09, 'Election': 2.8013022301820456e-07, 'General': 0.9999985694885254, 'Introduction': 4.2389098098283284e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 7.351155240087337e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 2.569796819784642e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 6.5216130273881845e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 3.36156290359213e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 2.718878455709728e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.9619838198536854e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.4793258173995127e-08, 'RVRequested': 8.385436789382084e-10, 'RVTaken': 1.76309644661643e-09, 'Session': 1.3507233553866627e-08, 'Sponsorship': 3.3828650991551967e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 9.425740188362397e-09, 'Vote': 3.643727097824012e-08, 'VotingIntention': 6.575876199121922e-08}\",\n[[\"Fulp\", \"PERSON\"], [\"United States of America\", \"UNPE\"], [\"6\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"One\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"2002\", \"DATE\"], [\"more than 80\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"25\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Michelle Obama\", \"PERSON\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"\\u201cLet\\u2019s Move!\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"\\u201cLet\\u2019s Move!\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"One\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Susan Rice\", \"PERSON\"], [\"2008\", \"DATE\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"A/65/270\", \"Symbol\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"draft resolution,\", \"DR\"], [\"\\u201cSport as a means to promote education, health, development and peace\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"A/65/L.4\", \"L\"], [\"agenda item 11\", \"AI\"], [\"\\u201cSport for peace and development\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"the United States\", \"UNPE\"], [\"decades\", \"DATE\"], [\"Obama\", \"PERSON\"], [\"these days\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 751,\n            'f': \"751\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 17,\n            'f': \"17\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.99992835521698,\n            'f': \"0.99992835521698\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Stone (Australia): Australia is committed to the principles of sport for development and peace and to the role the United Nations can play in furthering those principles. We welcome the report of the Secretary-General on this subject (A/65/270) introduced this morning and would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Wilfried Lemke, the Secretary-General\\u2019s Special Adviser on Sport for Development and Peace, for his efforts. We would also like to thank Tunisia for introducing the draft resolution (A/65/L.4) before us today, which Australia is pleased to co-sponsor. We would also like to thank Switzerland, and in particular Ambassador Peter Maurer, for his role as co-Chair, along with Ambassador Jomaa of Tunisia, of the Group of Friends over recent years. We appreciate Monaco\\u2019s taking over the co-chairship of the Group, and we look forward to working with Ambassadors Picco and Jomaa in strengthening the role of the Group of Friends. A growing body of research on sport for development provides strong empirical evidence of the direct role that sport, as a component of international development programmes, plays in advancing human rights, social inclusion and community development. Apart from physical fitness and good health, sport contributes to the development of other life skills and attributes, including confidence, self-esteem, teamwork, cooperation, social interaction, interpersonal communication, tolerance and conflict resolution. Sport offers a way to improve the lives of the most marginalized and excluded children, including girls, children from poor communities, out-of-school and working children, and people with disabilities. 7 Because of that, sport remains an integral tool in Australia\\u2019s development cooperation. Through the Australian Sports Outreach Programme, funding is provided in more than 40 countries for sport-for- development programmes at the grass-roots level. Working with local authorities and communities, Australia is able to increase the capacity of partners to plan and conduct quality sport-based activities that contribute to addressing locally identified development priorities. In 2010, the sport-for-development programmes include a children\\u2019s surf life-saving education programme in Viet Nam, increasing services to persons with disabilities through sport in Malawi, the establishment of youth clubs in post-conflict areas of Sri Lanka, a programme called Kicking AIDS Out, which uses sports analogies and games to convey messages about HIV and AIDS to young people in the Caribbean, and training players, coaches and administrators to promote active sports participation among rural women in Fiji. Sport in Australia has always helped build the social cohesion that binds families, communities, regions and the nation. It brings together people of different nationalities, religions and cultures and helps promote tolerance and understanding. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.0336340210415074e-06, 'ActionObject': 4.1086585156335786e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 4.383500709082e-06, 'Body': 5.4101299440389994e-08, 'Clarification': 9.66414177128172e-07, 'Conclusion': 2.402793199962616e-07, 'Election': 5.346983016352169e-06, 'General': 0.99992835521698, 'Introduction': 1.1571825098144473e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.700105881103809e-07, 'MeetingLocation': 9.160966101262602e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 3.937475128168444e-07, 'MeetingSegment': 4.216466913931072e-05, 'MeetingStatus': 4.4764655626750027e-07, 'OralStatement': 9.037678864842746e-06, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.3363180073611147e-07, 'RVRequested': 2.4937186537954403e-08, 'RVTaken': 1.624025856017397e-07, 'Session': 9.410680945620697e-07, 'Sponsorship': 7.022254635558056e-07, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.831468464137288e-07, 'Vote': 3.85299699701136e-07, 'VotingIntention': 2.3196205347630894e-06}\",\n[[\"Stone\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Australia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Australia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"A/65/270\", \"Symbol\"], [\"this morning\", \"TIME\"], [\"Wilfried Lemke\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Tunisia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"A/65/L.4\", \"L\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Australia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Switzerland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Peter Maurer\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Jomaa\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Tunisia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"recent years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Monaco\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Jomaa\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Australia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"more than 40\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Australia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"Viet Nam\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Malawi\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Sri Lanka\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Fiji\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Australia\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 752,\n            'f': \"752\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 18,\n            'f': \"18\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999998807907104,\n            'f': \"0.9999998807907104\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Aisi (Papua New Guinea): Let me begin by applauding the numerous delegations, especially that of Tunisia, that have helped to promote human development through sport and physical education through the draft resolution that is before us today (A/65/L.4). Sport and physical education play an increasingly important global role in maintaining national unity, health and cultural ties. The culture of sport provides a platform for social cohesion, value formation and national spirit. It is and can continue to be a way for different cultures to reach common ground, initiate dialogue and form relations. Sport does bring individuals and communities together. For instance, the Olympic Games, apart from showing off athletes\\u2019 incredible sporting abilities, contribute to intercultural ties that help bridge ethnic and cultural divides. Next year, the South Pacific Games will again bring together the best athletes of the Pacific islands to compete and participate in the spirit of sport. I should add here that we have just witnessed the successful completion of the Commonwealth 8 Games in New Delhi. I congratulate the Indian Government and people on their successful hosting of the event. Such sporting events provide a stage to promote healthy forms of nationalism, spirit and unity among countries. Promoting physical education is also a way to develop children\\u2019s talents and abilities to their fullest potential. There is a growing risk of deteriorating physical education programmes within countries. The shrinking number of sports and physical education programmes limits the positive impact that sports can have in helping promote and maintain a child\\u2019s physical and mental well-being. Physical education programmes within schools are essential and have been proven to enhance academic performance. Sports are a way for young individuals to express themselves as well as to play within a social community. They are a way to reduce disease, boost physical health and improve local development, and they provide alternatives to harmful activities such as drug abuse and crime. We are aware of the dangers faced by sportsmen and sportswomen, as well as by young athletes, who encounter violence, doping, overtraining, deprivation and other threats. Such dangers emphasize the need to develop more effective ways to fight against doping and destructive processes around our young athletes. We emphasize the importance of the international community in helping to provide funding and resources for sports-related institutions so that such institutions can effectively construct programmes that can help make sport and physical education available to everyone. The international community must work together to provide a code of good practices to continue to combat the dangers that young athletes face. By collectively working towards contributing to sport and physical education, we can help strengthen sport infrastructures for use as a tool for health, education, and social and cultural development. We call upon the international community and international sports bodies to continue helping developing countries, least-developed countries and small island developing States to help build sport and physical education. And here let me acknowledge the presence of the representative of the International Olympic Committee, who will speak later on. Sport and physical education may be used as a tool to further international goals, including those in the Millennium Development Goals. Sports provide a place to develop positive skills such as discipline, confidence and respect. We encourage the United Nations and participating members to find new and innovative ways to utilize sports as a source of communication and a way to reduce tension and generate dialogue. Lastly, we call on the international community, including international sports bodies and sport-related organizations, to partner in the development of sport and physical education programmes. In doing so, we are also investing in global conflict-prevention and peacebuilding efforts. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.0200963629358739e-08, 'ActionObject': 5.279617631970268e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 1.605240917967876e-08, 'Body': 6.255611306738018e-11, 'Clarification': 1.4807250536819083e-08, 'Conclusion': 6.405465047265579e-10, 'Election': 1.9019744001980143e-08, 'General': 0.9999998807907104, 'Introduction': 3.478916710264457e-08, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.7163113152918186e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 3.608691567791311e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 5.753135745578675e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 2.350573957698998e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 4.180705559519993e-09, 'OralStatement': 1.1770115548870308e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.3883361954801785e-09, 'RVRequested': 4.2802438676714516e-11, 'RVTaken': 1.7348071590372882e-10, 'Session': 1.277168149016461e-09, 'Sponsorship': 9.88712667293612e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.2921662628784247e-09, 'Vote': 2.6976965106229045e-09, 'VotingIntention': 1.4605852527438401e-08}\",\n[[\"Aisi\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Papua New Guinea\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Tunisia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"A/65/L.4\", \"L\"], [\"Next year\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 753,\n            'f': \"753\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 19,\n            'f': \"19\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999997615814209,\n            'f': \"0.9999997615814209\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Shanta Kumar (India): I am honoured and privileged to participate in today\\u2019s discussion on sport for peace and development. Let me begin by thanking the Secretary-General for his report on the item under discussion (A/65/270). Sports are an important element in building character. They not only teach people to be just and fair but also prepare them to face challenges in life. Sports, being a most popular activity for young people, can help to motivate young people, build teams, develop leadership, promote volunteering and educate, apart from ensuring fitness and healthy lifestyles. Sports also seek to promote peace, equality and friendship among all people and nations. In fact, it is hard to imagine a more powerful medium than sports to inspire and bring people together for a common purpose. Swami Vivekananda, the great philosopher from India, when approached by a young man to explain the meaning of the Bhagavad Gita, is reported to have looked at his physique and advised him first to go play football. \\u201cDevelop your body and mind\\u201d, Swamiji told the young man, \\u201cand then you will be better fit to study and understand the Gita\\u201d. Swamiji was clear that a healthy body and mind were fundamental in our quest for peace and sports \\u2014 indeed, they play a critical role towards that end. The intrinsic linkage between sports and games and the human quest for excellence has been recognized ever since the inception of human civilization. It reached its epitome in Ancient Greek civilization, which is the progenitor of the Olympic movement. Sports, games and physical fitness are an integral component of India\\u2019s civilization, as is evident from the existence of the highly evolved system of yoga and a vast range of highly developed indigenous games, including martial arts. After our independence, the integration of physical education and sports with formal education was emphasized in the first five-year plan itself. Our efforts have been focused on broad- basing sports and providing modern sports infrastructure. India adopted a national sports policy in 2001. We have also encouraged the autonomous functioning of national sports federations and are happy to see that today all sections of our society, including the media and the business sector, are actively involving themselves in the promotion of sports. Sports are also a most effective tool to help achieve development objectives in the areas of health, education, HIV/AIDS prevention, child protection and child development. They help generate public awareness and inspire broad, inclusive and committed action in support of developmental agendas. I am glad that there is substantial recognition of the value of sports to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals and that many sports personalities have associated themselves with the United Nations in creating public awareness and understanding of various issues that affect youth and society. In this context, I am of course particularly happy that our national cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar is a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Environment Programme and that our former tennis champion Vijay Amritraj was a United Nations Messenger of Peace in 2001. India was honoured to host the nineteenth Commonwealth Games, which have just concluded in Delhi. That two-week mega-event featured participation from 71 countries across the world and more than 7,000 athletes, who celebrated sporting excellence, human skill and endurance and, above all, courage and character. The Games upheld and renewed the essential spirit of peace, equality and friendship among all peoples and nations. We congratulate all those countries that successfully organized large global and regional sporting events during the past year. We also wish every success to all those countries that will be holding sporting events in the coming months and years. We believe that such mega-sporting events will strengthen 9 the cherished ties of goodwill and understanding that unite us as one family. \",\n\"{'Action': 6.165755905840342e-09, 'ActionObject': 2.0139521161866014e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 2.5293848793239704e-08, 'Body': 6.028321591911023e-11, 'Clarification': 8.897539593988313e-09, 'Conclusion': 1.2093135381974207e-09, 'Election': 3.970486517346217e-08, 'General': 0.9999997615814209, 'Introduction': 1.460012128973176e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.1774172747891498e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 4.655567931166615e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 1.050952436187913e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 4.0883737284502786e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 4.9818131842016555e-09, 'OralStatement': 2.6551933984819698e-09, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.2903915148096985e-09, 'RVRequested': 1.2068888943783662e-10, 'RVTaken': 1.9860620092959635e-10, 'Session': 2.2277157896155586e-09, 'Sponsorship': 3.84722947943672e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.0909808612069583e-09, 'Vote': 7.594184836534623e-09, 'VotingIntention': 1.2849360686573164e-08}\",\n[[\"Shanta Kumar\", \"PERSON\"], [\"India\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"A/65/270\", \"Symbol\"], [\"Swami Vivekananda\", \"PERSON\"], [\"India\", \"UNPE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"\\u201cDevelop your body and mind\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"\\u201cand then you will be better fit to study and understand the Gita\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"Olympic\", \"PERSON\"], [\"India\", \"UNPE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"India\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2001\", \"DATE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Sachin Tendulkar\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Vijay Amritraj\", \"PERSON\"], [\"2001\", \"DATE\"], [\"India\", \"UNPE\"], [\"71\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"more than 7,000\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the past year\", \"DATE\"], [\"the coming months and years\", \"DATE\"], [\"9\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 754,\n            'f': \"754\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 20,\n            'f': \"20\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999842643737793,\n            'f': \"0.9999842643737793\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Rulumeni (South Africa): It is an honour and privilege for South Africa to participate in this important debate on sport for development and peace. We thank the Secretary-General for his latest report on this issue, entitled, \\u201cSport for development and peace: strengthening the partnerships\\u201d (A/65/270). This debate comes just a few months after the 2010 F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration internationale de football (FIFA) World Cup, hosted for the first time on African soil. Indeed, South Africa prides itself on having hosted a spectacular and memorable event that has once again underscored Africa\\u2019s renewal. South Africa was the stage and Africa the theatre that further enhanced Africa\\u2019s social cohesion. It was in reality an African World Cup. In South Africa sport played a crucial role in the demise of the apartheid system and in the creation of a new society after 1994. The realization that sport can be used as a tool for reconstruction and development has been occasioned by the spirit of unity that prevailed during such events as the Rugby World Cup, the African Nations Cup, the Cricket World Cup and the recent Soccer World Cup. At the centre of South Africa\\u2019s sport-related reconstruction and development initiatives was our icon, Nelson Mandela. At this point I am reminded of his words when he said, \\u201cSport has the power to change the world, the power to inspire, the power to unite people in a way that little else can. Sport can create hope where there was once despair. It is an instrument for peace, even more powerful than Governments. It breaks down racial barriers. It laughs in the face of all kinds of discrimination.\\u201d As declared in the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1), sport has the potential to foster peace and development as well as to contribute to an atmosphere of tolerance and understanding. Sport has been recognized as a powerful tool in contributing to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In that regard, we advocate for the prioritization of Africa in our collective efforts, through sport and other means, to achieve these important and achievable goals. Before the beginning of the World Cup, President Jacob Zuma initiated the One Goal campaign, with a view to advancing efforts towards achieving education for all, which is the objective of MDG 2. South Africa views sport as an important part of education. This campaign is part of a range of national initiatives towards achieving universal access to education. In resolution 64/5, the Assembly also acknowledged the role played by sport in Africa as an instrument for the promotion of unity, solidarity, peace and reconciliation, and the preventive campaigns against scourges, such as HIV/AIDS, affecting the youth of the continent. Although sport alone cannot prevent conflict or build peace, it can contribute to broad and more comprehensive efforts in a number of important ways. The fact that the African Union declared \\u201cBuilding and sustaining peace through sport\\u201d as the theme for this year\\u2019s Africa Day was a clear recognition of the role of sport in peace and development. Coincidentally, the African Union declared 2010 the Year of Peace and Security. As an active stakeholder in Africa\\u2019s peacebuilding efforts, South Africa encourages the use of sport as a tool to foster peace and advance Africa\\u2019s development agenda. Since 1994, our Government has put in place a range of progressive legislation in its pursuit to empower women in sports. This has been inspired by the recognition that women have a crucial role to play in all aspects of societal development, including sport. Women\\u2019s empowerment has been manifested by the increasing number of women in leadership positions in the area of sport. Equally important, we have enacted legislation to protect and advance the empowerment of persons with disabilities, thus providing them with the opportunity to participate in sport with minimal or no hindrance. As a direct response to the Secretary- General\\u2019s call in his report contained in document A/61/373, South Africa is currently involved in legislative processes to infuse sport for development and peace into national legislation. South Africa welcomes the Action Plan on Sport for Development and Peace. Accordingly, we will implement the Action Plan at the national level in line with internationally agreed standards. Our Government reiterates the need for collaboration between national and international partners, including the United Nations system, to advance the objectives of the Action Plan. We also welcome the efforts of the Sport for 10 Development and Peace International Working Group and look forward to its report. We also look forward to the summary report of the activities around the 2010 FIFA World Cup, to be published later this year. South Africa supports the Assembly\\u2019s adoption of the draft resolution entitled \\u201cSport as a means to promote education, health, development and peace\\u201d (A/65/L.4), which we will also sponsor. In conclusion, South Africa once again expresses its gratitude to the United Nations, especially the Office of Sport for Development and Peace, and to the wider international community for all of the support offered to us during the World Cup. We hope that this event has permanently changed the perceptions of many about Africa. \",\n\"{'Action': 7.402832835623485e-08, 'ActionObject': 4.7064517616490775e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 7.343826951000665e-07, 'Body': 2.184960656848034e-09, 'Clarification': 1.530601707599999e-07, 'Conclusion': 6.090414217396756e-08, 'Election': 3.2833287377798115e-07, 'General': 0.9999842643737793, 'Introduction': 1.2428238733264152e-05, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.190206416230467e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 9.973235393090363e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 2.3607727328567307e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 9.695108929008711e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 1.1056707904799623e-07, 'OralStatement': 2.0769947539633904e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.2500106549850898e-07, 'RVRequested': 9.835928516110926e-09, 'RVTaken': 5.733461705403897e-09, 'Session': 2.2758955608992437e-08, 'Sponsorship': 5.261049373928017e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 5.028199367984598e-08, 'Vote': 1.387210630809932e-07, 'VotingIntention': 3.7423771459543786e-07}\",\n[[\"Rulumeni\", \"PERSON\"], [\"South Africa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"South Africa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"\\u201cSport for development and peace: strengthening the partnerships\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"A/65/270\", \"Symbol\"], [\"just a few months\", \"DATE\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"South Africa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"South Africa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"South Africa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"1994\", \"DATE\"], [\"South Africa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Nelson Mandela\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Sport\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Governments\", \"PERSON\"], [\"2005\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolution 60/1\", \"R\"], [\"Jacob Zuma\", \"PERSON\"], [\"One\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"South Africa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"resolution 64/5\", \"R\"], [\"\\u201cBuilding and sustaining peace through sport\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"South Africa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"1994\", \"DATE\"], [\"A/61/373\", \"Symbol\"], [\"South Africa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"South Africa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"later this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"South Africa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"entitled \\u201cSport as a means to promote education, health, development and peace\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"A/65/L.4\", \"L\"], [\"South Africa\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 755,\n            'f': \"755\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 21,\n            'f': \"21\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999878406524658,\n            'f': \"0.9999878406524658\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Ms. Picco (Monaco) (spoke in French): In the days just after the convening of the summit Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), my delegation can only welcome the recognition that Member States have given to sports. Indeed, by adopting the final document (resolution 65/1), the heads of State and Government confirmed the relevance of sport as a tool for education, development and peace that can promote cooperation, solidarity, tolerance, understanding, social inclusion and health at the local, national and international levels. The Secretary-General\\u2019s participation in the round table on the issue of sport as a development tool, organized on the sidelines of the summit, is further evidence of his commitment to promote the power of sport. This power has already helped to raise public awareness of the problems affecting us all today, such as HIV/AIDS, sexually communicable diseases, hunger and all forms of violence. The power of sport also lies in its ability to bring communities closer and to promote essential values such as fair play and discipline. These important results are the culmination, on the one hand, of the resolute action of the Secretary- General\\u2019s Special Adviser on Sport for Development and Peace, Mr. Wilfried Lemke, whom we thank for having implemented the Action Plan set out by the General Assembly. On the other hand, these achievements bear witness to our ability to work together and to the importance of partnerships. While the contribution of sport and physical activities to improving health no longer requires proof, its impact on overall development should be taken into account to inform our policies. In the context of this session of the General Assembly marked by the strengthening of the role of women within the United Nations, sport has more than ever demonstrated its ability to promote women\\u2019s empowerment. We very much hope that the victory of Ms. Dalma Rushdi Malhas, the first Saudi athlete to take part in the Youth Olympic Games and whose performance we commend, will inspire other young women to fully achieve their potential. The Sport for Development and Peace International Working Group, now acting under the stewardship of the Special Adviser, has developed the issue of sport within the context of child and adolescent development and has pinpointed strategic priority areas, which we fully endorse. The initiative \\u201cMake Your Peace\\u201d, born at the XXI Winter Olympic Games and the X Paralympic Winter Games in Canada, brought the values of Olympism into homes, schools and workplaces. The implementation of the Olympic Truce at the Paralympic Games strengthened recognition of the rights of people with disabilities and contributed to social cohesion. As my colleague from South Africa has just pointed out, the historic holding of the F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration internationale de football World Cup in South Africa in June served to pay tribute to Africa. It was also an opportunity to highlight very important issues such as the fight against human trafficking, racism, HIV/AIDS and the promotion of sustainable development. In particular, it was an opportunity to highlight the United Nations Development Programme Sustainable Transport Project, which is being carried out in conjunction with the Global Environment Facility, as well as the South African campaign to green the World Cup. But as the Special Adviser has often stressed, the organization of global events is not the only framework in which we should illustrate the effectiveness and benefits of sporting activities. He has also been able to convince us of the impact of simple initiatives at the grass-roots level, such as the construction of a football field for use by the local population of Bouak\\u00e9, C\\u00f4te d\\u2019Ivoire, which made it possible for them to better 11 accept the United Nations operation in that country and involved them and the young people in the peaceful development of their country. During the F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration internationale de football association World Cup, his Most Serene Highness Prince Albert II and Mr. Lemke, along with the Prime Minister of Western Cape Province Helen Zille and Capetown Mayor Dan Plato, inaugurated a community centre devoted to development in the municipality of Gugulethu that seeks to integrate disadvantaged youth in sporting activities. That programme should serve as a model to be developed in other African cities. This unifying characteristic of sport was also seen in Haiti \\u2014 where sport has afforded thousands of young people an opportunity to escape the difficulties of their daily lives \\u2014 and is part of overall reconstruction efforts on behalf of populations stricken by natural disasters. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.9478601132050244e-07, 'ActionObject': 1.5191926650004461e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 6.755756771781307e-07, 'Body': 4.857866109375664e-09, 'Clarification': 2.3005134153208928e-07, 'Conclusion': 5.740498920658865e-08, 'Election': 5.452977234199352e-07, 'General': 0.9999878406524658, 'Introduction': 6.4333967202401254e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 3.800583314728101e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 1.212761731039791e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 2.721765746116489e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 2.4746677809162065e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 1.0178030152019346e-07, 'OralStatement': 1.1283073320100812e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 9.389324873154692e-08, 'RVRequested': 8.590329336755076e-09, 'RVTaken': 1.1092143203939031e-08, 'Session': 3.904270684529365e-08, 'Sponsorship': 3.1891023155594667e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.4644641055383545e-07, 'Vote': 1.2060468179697637e-07, 'VotingIntention': 5.470916448757634e-07}\",\n[[\"Picco\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Monaco\", \"UNPE\"], [\"resolution 65/1\", \"R\"], [\"all today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Wilfried Lemke\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Dalma Rushdi Malhas\", \"PERSON\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"\\u201cMake Your Peace\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"Canada\", \"UNPE\"], [\"South Africa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"South Africa\", \"UNPE\"], [\"June\", \"DATE\"], [\"Bouak\\u00e9\", \"PERSON\"], [\"C\\u00f4te d\\u2019Ivoire\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Albert II\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Lemke\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Helen Zille\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Dan Plato\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Haiti\", \"UNPE\"], [\"thousands\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 756,\n            'f': \"756\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 22,\n            'f': \"22\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999741315841675,\n            'f': \"0.9999741315841675\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"The Secretary-General\\u2019s report (A/65/270) is eloquent with respect to the many initiatives undertaken by Member States and about the different fields in which sport may have an impact, from road safety to birth registration.

The report also highlights the crucial importance of partnerships involving Governments, the world of sports, civil society and regional cooperation efforts. The contribution of the International Olympic Committee to our work during this session was a clear example of this. The Principality of Monaco will join this common endeavour, in keeping with the unreserved commitment of His Most Serene Highness Prince Albert II, the recipient last month of the United Nations prize for the Millennium Development Goals in recognition of his involvement in support of peace through sport.

President Morales, who usually travels with a football team accompanying him, makes sport an element of integration among peoples, making it possible to overcome hurdles that have often kept neighbouring countries and peoples apart, as has been the case in our region over the past few decades. For us in Bolivia, sport has become the main mechanism for developing football fields and sport centres in a way that has never been done in previous years. Bolivia has invested in sport because we feel that it is the main mechanism for ensuring that young people can be kept away from crime and drug addiction, as well as for bolstering ties of solidarity and fraternity. Above all, sport makes it possible to overcome elements of discrimination and racism that still exist in society, specifically through the promotion of sport among young people without regard to gender, thus ensuring that there is greater equality between men and women. For the Plurinational State of Bolivia, sport is a fundamental element for peace that makes it possible to overcome a great deal of the tension and a great number of the conflicts that often still exist. It is precisely through sport that it is possible to bring about a spirit of brotherhood and fraternity, hence the importance that we as a State and Government ascribe to sport as a driving force for peace and development; for we believe that a society that manages to achieve the goal of overcoming poverty and marginalization is also a society that above all promotes sport among its citizens. Promoting sport means promoting health. For us, therefore, it is also a paramount founding element of development. We in Bolivia have decisively embarked upon an effort to show the world that sport at high altitudes in no way damages human health. Over the past few years, regrettably, we have been hostage to a number of actions vetoing high altitude sport, specifically in qualifying games for the World Cup in stadiums like the one in the city of La Paz, which is at an altitude of more than 3,600 metres. We have spoken out against such discrimination. Our President himself, together with his football team, has demonstrated that playing above 6,000 metres, on a football field on Cerro Sajama, in no way affects health, and that everyone without exception must play without regard to the altitude, climate or weather conditions in which they may find themselves. Sport should not be subject to any sort of discrimination. For the Plurinational State of Bolivia, it is vital to promote actions in support of sport in the fight against drug addiction and drug trafficking. We are firmly convinced that one of the great mechanisms for ensuring that young people are kept away from drug trafficking and drug addiction is through sport. We are therefore great advocates of a major campaign to promote sport in the fight against drugs. Finally, Bolivia is resolutely committed to peace. We believe that nothing brings people together more closely than the practice of sport. \",\n\"{'Action': 3.977464402282749e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.6529638102724675e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 1.1064656746384571e-07, 'Body': 4.3402889615684614e-10, 'Clarification': 1.100853452840056e-07, 'Conclusion': 1.0099528324758467e-08, 'Election': 7.225400366905887e-08, 'General': 0.9999990463256836, 'Introduction': 2.9453568117787654e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.0942043715544969e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 2.912545937761024e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 3.523386027382003e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 3.075440346833602e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 4.676499543165846e-08, 'OralStatement': 4.009134002558312e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.338875131930763e-08, 'RVRequested': 5.396386670852849e-10, 'RVTaken': 1.4902317158060896e-09, 'Session': 8.534247086799951e-09, 'Sponsorship': 4.294179234420881e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 6.862601598101037e-09, 'Vote': 3.578668383852346e-08, 'VotingIntention': 1.2608548161097133e-07}\",\n[[\"Sol\\u00f3n\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Evo Morales Ayma\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Morales\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the past few decades\", \"DATE\"], [\"previous years\", \"DATE\"], [\"the Plurinational State of Bolivia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the past few years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Cerro Sajama\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the Plurinational State of Bolivia\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 758,\n            'f': \"758\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 24,\n            'f': \"24\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9138248562812805,\n            'f': \"0.9138248562812805\",\n        },\n\"Introduction\",\n\"The President (spoke in French): I call on the observer of Palestine.\",\n\"{'Action': 6.328806989586155e-08, 'ActionObject': 4.247266716106424e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 1.1782738511101343e-05, 'Body': 1.9656127392408962e-08, 'Clarification': 2.65801986643055e-07, 'Conclusion': 5.2305262215668336e-05, 'Election': 5.707489592055026e-08, 'General': 0.08606759458780289, 'Introduction': 0.9138248562812805, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.889185696768436e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 3.926658393993421e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 4.1572274511736396e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 5.806117314932635e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 4.812758334082901e-07, 'OralStatement': 3.2357660995074866e-10, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.948605313373264e-05, 'RVRequested': 4.860482022195356e-06, 'RVTaken': 3.725370945062423e-08, 'Session': 3.939536696861978e-08, 'Sponsorship': 1.162185570002805e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 4.2113501876883674e-06, 'Vote': 1.2194842611279455e-06, 'VotingIntention': 6.394395768438699e-06}\",\n[]],\n [{\n            'v': 759,\n            'f': \"759\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 25,\n            'f': \"25\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999974966049194,\n            'f': \"0.9999974966049194\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Hijazi (Palestine): I would like to begin by thanking the Secretary-General for his report (A/65/270) and by commending the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for Development and Peace. We also commend the crucial role of the Sport for Development and Peace International Working Group in shaping the global framework of sport for peace and development, as well as other actors for their support for this important work. Palestine believes that the culture of sport is an immensely positive force for development in any society. In this regard, we fully agree with the UNESCO characterization of sport as a fundamental right for all. Harnessing the positive energy inherent in sport \\u2014 which demands respect for the human values of respect for all, including opponents, non-violence, teamwork, acceptance of rules and fairness \\u2014 makes sport a valuable asset in any nation\\u2019s efforts towards development and peaceful coexistence. Sport is also an engine of economic development and social integration, which are crucial elements of overall development. Palestine has invested much sincere effort and energy in this area, for we believe in the positive potential and the as yet unexplored development dimension of sport. In the past three years, Palestinian sport has truly evolved from being a luxury of the few to an aspiration within reach of all athletes regardless of social, economic or other difficulties. In that short span of time, Palestine has developed and promoted women\\u2019s teams in various sports. Those teams have competed locally and internationally, shifting women\\u2019s participation in Palestine from a few exceptions to an acceptable and encouraged area of professional and personal opportunity. In that regard, we would like to express our sincere appreciation for the support extended to Palestinian sport by the international community, particularly by the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Brazil. Their assistance has been invaluable and a subject of deep appreciation from Palestinian athletes and the Palestinian people. Also during this period, Palestine has proudly hosted friendly and competitive games with international teams. These games were in fact a testament to the progress that Palestinian sport has achieved and a reflection of our belief in sport as an agent of development and peaceful relations between nations. While we are profoundly proud of our achievements in sport thus far, we are also deeply troubled by the continuous difficulties our athletes and efforts confront from the occupying Power. Our progress has been slowed, and on some occasions disrupted, by the various obstacles and restrictions needlessly and punitively employed against our athletes and our efforts at development. Israel, the occupying Power, continues to obstruct the right of Palestinian athletes to move and travel without hindrance. On several occasions, that punitive policy has prevented some of our star athletes from participating in important team practice games in the occupied Palestinian territory and abroad. The latest such occasion was 5 October, when the captain of the Palestinian team, who lives in Gaza, was banned from going to the West Bank for a match. Those restrictions also affect our ability to bring in sports equipment or to develop proper infrastructure, including stadiums.

Allow me to acknowledge the invaluable contributions of the United Nations and the Secretary-General in elevating the role of sport as a tool for development and peace. His annual report (A/65/270), which has been just presented, is living proof of that. In our capacity as Observer to the United Nations General Assembly, the IOC intends to further strengthen its ties and cooperation with the United Nations and to assist Member States and the United Nations Administration in their endeavours. Allow me 14 also to thank Mr. Wilfred Lemke, Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for Development and Peace, for the important part that he is playing in expanding the role of sport in United Nations human development and peacebuilding efforts. The IOC\\u2019s commitment to place sport at the service of humankind is enshrined in its founding document, the Olympic Charter. The Charter defines Olympism as a philosophy of life that seeks to place sport at the service of the harmonious development of humankind, with a view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity. The sporting movement translates that philosophy into actions in a variety of ways, starting, of course, with its premier event, the Olympic Games. The Games provide a global forum for peaceful competition and interaction in an atmosphere of fair play and mutual respect, showing by example that we can put aside our differences and find common ground. That ideal can be seen in some memorable moments, as exemplified by the actions of the young people who participated in the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in Singapore last month. Much of the Olympic Movement\\u2019s development work occurs far from the media spotlight. Last May, we opened a new youth Olympic development centre in Zambia. That innovative project combines sport with educational programmes, health services and community events. It is a good example of an effective multiparty partnership \\u2014 in this case between the Government of the Republic of Zambia, the Zambian National Olympic Committee and international and national sports federations. Many of our efforts are closely aligned with the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). For example, the promotion and empowerment of women in and through sport and gender equality are specifically addressed in the Olympic Charter. The IOC has steadily increased the participation and involvement of women in competitions and the organization of the Olympic Games. For the first time, women will participate in every sport on the Olympic programme at the Games in London in 2012. The IOC formally acknowledged its obligation to environmental sustainability more than 15 years ago by adopting the environment as the third pillar of the Olympic Movement, along with sport and culture. We work closely with the United Nations Environmental Programme to ensure that we live up to our responsibilities in that area. We work with UNESCO, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other partners to provide value-based education to young people and sustenance to refugees. We work with the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, UNICEF, the World Health Organization and the Red Cross Movement to combat HIV and AIDS, malaria and non-communicable diseases. In many of those initiatives, sport is a catalyst for action. It breaks down barriers between communities. It is a magnet for young people. It helps keep them in school and focused. It gives them mental strength and teaches them leadership skills. They learn the true meaning and value of teamwork and a team spirit. Sport is not the answer to all the world\\u2019s problems. It does not even have the leading role in addressing those problems. We look to the United Nations, Governments and specialized non-governmental organizations to take the lead in promoting development. The IOC salutes the efforts of Governments around the world to promote development, but we also urge them to embrace sport as a partner in those efforts and to give sport the attention, promotion and resources that it needs in order to effectively contribute to national development agendas. The IOC acknowledges that real progress is possible with effective partnerships, as called for in MDG 8. The Secretary-General\\u2019s report offers example after example, from countries around the world, of alliances that use sport in creative ways. The IOC and sport as a whole are doing their best, but more could be done with more consideration of sport as a factor in human development and peace and by factoring it into development agendas at every level. However, we need comprehensive evaluation and monitoring of sport programmes for human development so that we can learn what works and what does not. We need more research and better monitoring tools, including widely accepted benchmarks and standards. Sport is a powerful tool for development and peace. The challenge is to make the most of that tool. The International Olympic Committee stands ready to play its part. The IOC assures the Assembly that it will do its best to be its greatest partner. \",\n\"{'Action': 5.675626368883968e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.555489035354185e-07, 'AgendaStatus':

sincere thanks to the President for organizing this important meeting. I would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report (A/65/269) on the activities related to the declaration of 2010 as the International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures. That declaration was the logical result of the growing international awareness of the important need for a rapprochement of cultures through dialogue, which is an urgent issue of concern to us all. The meetings and symposia that we have seen take place this year are perhaps the best testament to the importance of diversity as a source of enrichment for humankind and, when exploited through constructive and innovative 15 dialogue, as a fountain of creativity, modernity, progress and advancement. I come from Lebanon, an eastern country that has had a unique social and political experience and a nation that allows for dialogue and coexistence between religions and cultures that is an example of tolerance. Here I would like to recall the statement by the President of Lebanon when he spoke before the Assembly on 24 September. He affirmed that Lebanon will always remain open to dialogue and human and cultural interaction in a rich and creative manner, loyal to its main message, in spite of the challenges that it faces, in the promotion of a State of law and order and the values of democracy, freedom and harmony on which it is based. This year, in accordance with our openness to dialogue, we joined the Group of Friends of the Alliance of Civilizations. We consider the Alliance as an essential forum for dialogue among civilizations. The Alliance guarantees the necessary space for involving civil society, including women and youth, and for exchanging experiences and building strategies in consolidating the culture of peace. Lebanon continues to call for rich human and cultural interaction in a constructive and innovative way. We believe that such dialogue begins with the recognition of others\\u2019 identities and the religious and cultural characteristics of each group. We believe that fear, hostility and intimidation have no place in such an effort. In that regard, we welcome the tireless efforts made by the United Nations and its specialized agencies and programmes, particularly UNESCO in the cultural, information and technological fields, with a view to enabling societies, especially women and youth, to overcome ignorance and poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals. We also welcome all the symposiums that have been held and all the early warning mechanisms that have been deployed to pre-empt conflicts before they erupt and to deal with root causes through the use of preventive diplomacy and the establishment of regional and international partnerships that work to prevent war and conflict, which have greatly afflicted our world. In the same context, Lebanon has always sent out a message of dialogue, as exemplified during the interactive dialogue that took place in the Security Council last May under the theme \\u201cIntercultural 16 dialogue for peace and security\\u201d (see S/PV.6322). We do this based on our belief in the importance of dialogue as a choice and a culture, as well as our pledge to abide by the Charter and the International Declaration of Human Rights. We hope that international efforts to promote dialogue among civilizations will succeed in promoting not only a culture of peace but also stability, peace and security in the whole world. The Middle East as a region deserves comprehensive and just peace based on international resolutions, the Arab Peace Initiative in all its aspects, justice and what is right. The time has come for human development. Such development can only start with the promotion of a culture of peace that enhances communication and tolerance among civilizations and promotes mutual respect among them in a responsible and transparent manner. That should involve all stakeholders at the governmental level in identifying priorities and overcoming disputes and differences through dialogue between developed and developing countries in order to rise to the challenges faced by humankind and find solutions to real problems in line with people\\u2019s expectations and aspirations. \",\n\"{'Action': 3.704750284327929e-08, 'ActionObject': 8.712498100749144e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 3.469383500487311e-07, 'Body': 1.4710578311039058e-09, 'Clarification': 1.803710603098807e-07, 'Conclusion': 3.144726790083041e-08, 'Election': 3.971063478047654e-08, 'General': 0.9999963045120239, 'Introduction': 1.6288246342810453e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 7.992867701034356e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 3.7040791767140036e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 8.15018719180216e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 7.414768106173142e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 2.7567574889530988e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.399404254698311e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.2259151794278296e-08, 'RVRequested': 1.8224450837323047e-09, 'RVTaken': 3.823596994578793e-09, 'Session': 6.327523838223215e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.0074470147003467e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.902041096319863e-08, 'Vote': 7.275465563338912e-09, 'VotingIntention': 3.532571781761362e-07}\",\n[[\"Habib\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Lebanon\", \"UNPE\"], [\"A/65/269\", \"Symbol\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"15\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Lebanon\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Lebanon\", \"UNPE\"], [\"24 September\", \"DATE\"], [\"Lebanon\", \"UNPE\"], [\"This year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Lebanon\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Lebanon\", \"UNPE\"], [\"last May\", \"DATE\"], [\"\\u201cIntercultural 16 dialogue for peace and security\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"Charter\", \"PERSON\"], [\"resolutions,\", \"R\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 772,\n            'f': \"772\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 38,\n            'f': \"38\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999697208404541,\n            'f': \"0.9999697208404541\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): First of all, the delegation of Kazakhstan would like to express its appreciation to President Deiss for the holding of this joint debate on items 14 and 15 of the agenda, \\u201cGlobal Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations\\u201d and \\u201cCulture of Peace\\u201d. We also wish to thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the comprehensive report on intercultural, interreligious and intercivilizational dialogue (A/65/269). It provides an overview of activities undertaken by the main United Nations entities engaged in promoting dialogue among civilizations, cultures and religions. Its findings and recommendations take on great significance in our contemporary times, when multilateralism is being strengthened. Yet at the same time, paradoxically, there are forces that cause schisms and unrest in society. The report, submitted pursuant to resolutions 60/4 and 64/81, covers a wide range of themes, including the International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures, which was initiated by Kazakhstan and supported by Member States. We would like also to take note of the detailed information on the Third Forum of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations, and the work done so far to carry forward the objectives of the United Nations in fostering global harmony and understanding through outreach and collaboration with faith-based organizations, as well as through communication, awareness-raising and educational activities around the world. Pursuant to resolution 64/81, in which the Assembly invited the Secretary-General to organize a special activity to celebrate the Year, a special event was organized on 21 April 2010 at United Nations Headquarters by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. The President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session and the Secretary-General made statements. At the meeting, different voices were heard, each reflecting on a specific dimension of public action to promote the rapprochement of cultures. The Vice- Minister of Culture of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Mr. Telebekov, presented the unique experience of our country in establishing political and administrative institutions aimed at ensuring communication and understanding among the various cultures that create the mosaic of Kazakhstan. At Kazakhstan\\u2019s suggestion, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization \\u2014 UNESCO \\u2014 developed an action plan for observing the International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures with a large number of events, forums and conferences convened worldwide. The Assembly designated UNESCO as the lead agency for the International Year, which was launched at UNESCO headquarters in Paris on 18 February 2010. On that occasion, the Director-General of UNESCO convened a high-level panel on peace and dialogue among cultures, which was comprised of prominent political, intellectual and religious personalities from all regions of the world. The focus on awareness-raising, implicit in the goals of the Year, resulted in worldwide dissemination of information and the organization of several international and regional conferences, meetings and events. To date, over 700 activities are envisaged within the framework of the Year. The variety of projects presented in the fields of arts, education and youth leadership bears witness to the different forms that dialogue and the rapprochement of cultures can assume. Kazakhstan is of the view that regional organizations play a significant role in strengthening international dialogue. Acting as a coordinator of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA), Kazakhstan has developed the action plan for implementing the CICA Catalogue of Confidence- Building Measures in humanitarian issues, and also organized a series of international conferences on intercultural cooperation and tolerance. More recently, the Alliance of Civilizations has held a vast array of high-profile events on the themes of multiculturalism and global understanding, both of which have gained high priority on its political agenda. The contributions of the relevant United Nations entities provided valuable input to the report and are highlighted in its first two sections, which are devoted to the International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures, which is being celebrated in 2010 under the aegis of UNESCO. The third section is devoted to the Third Forum of the Alliance of Civilizations, held in Rio de Janiero in May 2010. In addition to the International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures and the Alliance of Civilizations, the United Nations system has continued to undertake a wide range of educational and communication activities to achieve the Year\\u2019s objectives. Another valuable contribution of the United Nations system to promoting interreligious dialogue consists in collaboration with faith-based organizations and engaging them in its policy and advocacy work. Such initiatives have a double positive effect: they bring together peoples from different faiths to discuss issues they have in common and they help to link those groups as partners with the United Nations and its development objectives. In that context, President Nursultan Nazarbayev\\u2019s initiative to convene congresses of leaders of the world\\u2019s traditional religions, held in Kazakhstan, has been thriving since 2003 and has added to international efforts to promote interreligious and intercultural dialogue. I am convinced that Kazakhstan\\u2019s forum, which has been widely recognized as an effective platform to discuss the role of religious leaders in fostering peace and other issues, will continue to contribute in an extremely meaningful way towards 17 developing the worldwide process of the dialogue of civilizations. I would like to stress that tolerance, trust, tradition and transparency constitute the guiding principles of Kazakhstan\\u2019s 2010 chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The key event in that context was the OSCE High-level Conference on Tolerance and Non-Discrimination, held in Astana on 29 and 30 June this year. That forum demonstrated very effectively the importance of sharing experiences with regard to inter-ethnic and interreligious accord, as well as the need to fulfil commitments to promote the OSCE values of tolerance, non-discrimination and respect for diversity. In the wider context, the theme of tolerance will also be highlighted during our 2011 chairmanship of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. In conclusion, let me express my confidence that our common collective effort at all levels, from the grass-roots to the international, will reduce mistrust and prejudice and enhance genuine dialogue and cooperation among our myriad cultures, thereby fostering mutual understanding and stability in the world. \",\n\"{'Action': 8.531759476682055e-07, 'ActionObject': 3.310307477022434e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 1.8161393882110133e-06, 'Body': 2.3319048025882694e-08, 'Clarification': 7.150612191253458e-07, 'Conclusion': 1.8758666442408867e-07, 'Election': 9.838236110226717e-07, 'General': 0.9999697208404541, 'Introduction': 6.509194918180583e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.0592351884497475e-07, 'MeetingLocation': 5.153929691914527e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 9.950403523362183e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 1.3143468095222488e-05, 'MeetingStatus': 3.051960391076136e-07, 'OralStatement': 1.0496844424778828e-06, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.2653742348666128e-07, 'RVRequested': 1.793877046907255e-08, 'RVTaken': 6.225901216794227e-08, 'Session': 1.6511390299456252e-07, 'Sponsorship': 1.706286383296174e-07, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 4.607791197486222e-07, 'Vote': 2.0116283394600032e-07, 'VotingIntention': 2.41735574491031e-06}\",\n[[\"Aitimova\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Deiss\", \"PERSON\"], [\"14\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"15\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"\\u201cGlobal Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations\\u201d and \\u201cCulture of Peace\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"Ban Ki-moon\", \"PERSON\"], [\"A/65/269\", \"Symbol\"], [\"resolutions 60/4\", \"R\"], [\"64/81\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"resolution 64/81\", \"R\"], [\"the Year\", \"DATE\"], [\"21\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"April 2010\", \"PARA\"], [\"the Republic of Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Telebekov\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the International Year\", \"DATE\"], [\"18 February 2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"the Year\", \"DATE\"], [\"700\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the Year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"third\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"May 2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"Year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Nursultan Nazarbayev\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2003\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"17\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Kazakhstan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"Astana\", \"PERSON\"], [\"29\", \"DATE\"], [\"2011\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 773,\n            'f': \"773\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 39,\n            'f': \"39\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999897480010986,\n            'f': \"0.9999897480010986\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Al-Jarman (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in Arabic): The discussions of the General Assembly today on the two items relating to the Global Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations and the Culture of Peace take on particular importance at a time when humankind continues to face growing trends of inequality, occupation, oppression, conflict, violations of human rights and other forms of hatred and racism. Those trends reveal growing manifestations of extremism and defamation towards the cultures and beliefs of others. Recent public tensions resulting from the irresponsible and intolerant campaigns calling for attacks on Islam and Muslims, and foreigners in general, and public reactions towards those campaigns underline the gravity of this problem and its implications. They also provide a strong motive for us to redouble our efforts towards strengthening mechanisms of dialogue and religious and cultural tolerance among all peoples, who all without exception share in the common heritage of humankind. The United Arab Emirates \\u2014 which believes that dialogue among civilizations and a culture of peace are key priorities in its global strategy for protecting societies against all forms of violence, extremism and 18 terrorism \\u2014 was one of the first countries to support the initiative on dialogue among civilizations launched by Turkey and Spain in 2005, as well as the initiative launched by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, and all other important endeavours carried out by the United Nations in that regard. The United Arab Emirates also supported the Madrid Declaration of the World Conference on Dialogue in 2008, which called for promoting the principles of peace and dialogue among religions, and the recent ministerial meeting of the Alliance of Civilizations, which was held on the margins of the general debate at the current session of the General Assembly. The United Arab Emirates has sought to build bridges of confidence and partnerships with the rest of the world through promoting a culture of dialogue, tolerance, openness and constructive cooperation with all countries, and regional and international groups. Those principles have also been reflected in a series of national legislative measures and laws that ensure harmony and peaceful coexistence among ethnic groups and followers of different faiths, and guarantee their freedom to practise their religious rites and ceremonies and express their cultural diversity in the United Arab Emirates. That has contributed to consolidating justice, strengthening the rule of law, and promoting respect for human rights and stability in the United Arab Emirates. The efforts by the United Arab Emirates were not limited only to the national level, but also extended to the international level, including through the provision of direct and indirect economic, humanitarian and relief assistance to developing countries and countries emerging from conflict and natural disasters. This was done with a view to supporting efforts aimed at achieving national reconciliation, rehabilitation and stability in those countries, and in promoting a culture of peace and respect for human rights. As a member of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, under the auspices of UNESCO, the United Arab Emirates has worked on enhancing its multifaceted contribution to the protection of the common heritage of mankind. We attach great importance to the efforts of the United Nations and other Member States to strengthening international peace and security, the rule of law, concepts of tolerance, understanding, multilateralism and solidarity among peoples, and a culture of peace. We emphasize that in order to achieve all those goals, we need to start with a genuine global partnership that aims at encouraging dialogue among the various cultures and civilizations and at instilling the spirit of tolerance and respect for the sacred sites of other peoples and understanding the sensitive aspects of their cultures, especially in our globalized age, with its modern communication technologies that provide unique and ever greater opportunities for connecting and reaching people. As we believe that dialogue among civilizations must take various forms, including North-South dialogue, East-West dialogue and other forms of cultural exchange, we affirm that mutual enrichment of any dialogue in that context must be based on equality, objectivity and transparency. Such activities must also include adequate measures to address any acts of violence or discrimination based on religion, race or sex, in order to contain their negative impact on societies. We therefore call for the development of a standardized global approach to deal with acts that constitute a clear and continuing threat to peace, security and stability in the world. Measures to criminalize incitement of violence on religious pretexts, including incitement to abuse or desecrate sanctities of other religions, should also be adopted. We also emphasize, in that regard, the need to address attempts aimed at defaming religions and at inciting religious hatred in general, by developing local, regional and international strategies based on constructive debates and dialogue among cultures and civilizations and full respect for all beliefs and religions. In that regard, we declare our support, which has been continuous for the past 10 years, for the Global Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations, adopted by the General Assembly in resolution 56/6. We also affirm our support for the declaration of 2010 as the International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures, with a view to demonstrating that diversity is a source of enrichment, creativity and innovation for humanity. This also leads us to realizing the importance of demonstrating a true and serious international determination to address the root causes of emerging conflicts and disputes, especially the causes relating to that oldest of conflicts, namely, the continued Israeli occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories. Finally, we hope that our deliberations on the two agenda items will lead to strengthened plans for achieving greater understanding, rapprochement and openness among countries and peoples, especially in containing and addressing the most pressing regional and international issues, including issues of security, peace, disarmament, poverty, unemployment and violations of human rights. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.8090459263930825e-07, 'ActionObject': 9.643700593642279e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 4.751488233978307e-07, 'Body': 5.989014617568955e-09, 'Clarification': 2.2847558511784882e-07, 'Conclusion': 6.611598735162261e-08, 'Election': 2.939918886113446e-07, 'General': 0.9999897480010986, 'Introduction': 2.0134393707849085e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 3.216095478819625e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 1.7151337772247643e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 3.188378627783095e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 5.048210368840955e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 7.834069748469119e-08, 'OralStatement': 3.644843786787533e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 5.1334765771571256e-08, 'RVRequested': 4.746854465054184e-09, 'RVTaken': 1.7911368388467963e-08, 'Session': 5.72040974589072e-08, 'Sponsorship': 7.90376972759077e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 8.901290726726074e-08, 'Vote': 7.434796600591653e-08, 'VotingIntention': 8.761789445088652e-07}\",\n[[\"Al-Jarman\", \"PERSON\"], [\"United Arab Emirates\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"United Arab Emirates\", \"UNPE\"], [\"18\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Turkey\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Spain\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2005\", \"DATE\"], [\"Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud\", \"PERSON\"], [\"United Arab Emirates\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2008\", \"DATE\"], [\"United Arab Emirates\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the United Arab Emirates\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the United Arab Emirates\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the United Arab Emirates\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the United Arab Emirates\", \"UNPE\"], [\"past 10\", \"PARA\"], [\"resolution 56/6\", \"R\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 774,\n            'f': \"774\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 40,\n            'f': \"40\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999977350234985,\n            'f': \"0.9999977350234985\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Al-Hubail (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I have the pleasure to convey our thanks to the Secretary- General for the report before us (A/65/629), which details the achievements and activities of United Nations bodies with respect to intercivilizational, intercultural and interreligious dialogue. I should also like to pay tribute to the efforts of UNESCO for having successfully celebrated 2010 as the International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures. We should like to thank the Director-General of UNESCO for her annual report on the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World The State of Kuwait is happy to participate in this discussion. We would like to reaffirm that the world currently faces great challenges resulting from views and ideologies characterized by extremism and bigotry, held by some groups, entities and individuals in certain countries of the world, which do not respect the cultures of others. Such intolerance has even reached a level where some use ideological and physical violence to impose their views and ideas. If we want to successfully support a comprehensive and realistic dialogue among the civilizations and peoples of the world, we must share a sincere desire to combat the extremist ideas and actions on the part of some who disparage others\\u2019 religions, given that such ideas hamper United Nations efforts to bring about rapprochement. Otherwise, the other side is given new justifications for its attempts to spread its violent ideas and convince others of the correctness of their views. My delegation salutes resolution 64/81, which states, in paragraph 5, that the right to freedom of expression carries with it duties and responsibilities that may be subject to certain restrictions. We must discourage incitement against religious beliefs, because that has negative consequences for human rights. We believe that in that regard a general evaluation is needed of the efforts of the United Nations and 19 non-governmental organizations, as well as of efforts and initiatives by regional and international organizations. To achieve a strong and sound foundation for dialogue among civilizations, we need to unify the efforts and programmes of the various entities in order to promote interreligious and intercultural dialogue among civilizations. That will lead to the spread of the principles of peace, tolerance and respect. We must recall here that a dialogue or alliance among civilizations does not mean a fusion of cultures, creeds and faiths. Civilization is the tent that includes all cultures and religions; the purpose of dialogue among civilizations is to study the roots of differences and to deal with them, while being respectful of our differences. The State of Kuwait supports the efforts of the United Nations regarding an ongoing dialogue among civilizations. As decreed by our head of State, we have put in place a national plan of action based on our belief in outreach to and interaction among civilizations. We have acceded to the initiative of the Alliance of Civilizations, joined its Group of Friends and participated in all its forums, particularly the third, held in Rio de Janeiro in May. Openness towards other cultures, tolerance and interaction with others have been part of Kuwaiti culture, intellect and ideology from the beginning. That is enshrined in our Constitution, which allows others to practise their religion freely, safely and in peace, and this has attracted people of 120 nationalities and from all cultures and religions to live in our country in stability, tolerance and mutual respect. A culture of peace and coexistence, based on outreach among civilizations, should be based on strategic principles that give it strength and continuity, and should help civil society, individuals and institutions to achieve their objectives. We cite in that connection Kuwait\\u2019s national plan of action, which has set forth four strategic principles to help achieve its aims. First, we should reinforce our culture of peace, moderation and tolerance; secondly, combat extremism, terrorism and violence; build a societal and national consensus based on the principles and values of outreach among civilizations; and fourthly, cooperate with regional and international institutions, thus laying the foundations for understanding of our shared human concerns. Additionally, Kuwait has established an International Centre for Compromise 20 that calls for moderation in thought and compromise in dealing with others, which are based on the principles of our religion. The Centre has held many conferences and symposiums at the national, regional and international levels. Various specialized Government departments have set up programmes and forums aimed at every sector of society in order to achieve awareness of moderation and understanding among people. We have held and sponsored many international and regional conferences and forums promoting an attitude of moderation in Islam and how to spread religious tolerance and respect for beliefs and cultural specificities among peoples, as well as how to achieve equality so that we may arrive at a climate of international security in which all civilizations can live in peace. \",\n\"{'Action': 2.088005324196729e-08, 'ActionObject': 5.927289947749159e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 1.240124447576818e-07, 'Body': 4.27666235758295e-10, 'Clarification': 6.276510333691476e-08, 'Conclusion': 1.2407531890801238e-08, 'Election': 5.6727458286331967e-08, 'General': 0.9999977350234985, 'Introduction': 1.5377980844277772e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 5.631217270263278e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 1.3091425721256655e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 3.2864648780162042e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 1.4524765390433458e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 1.6038082861769e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.4068857190352446e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.755827128135934e-08, 'RVRequested': 1.471699984101349e-09, 'RVTaken': 1.181502562452863e-09, 'Session': 4.002815856551933e-09, 'Sponsorship': 3.2714924103061094e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 8.189591227392157e-09, 'Vote': 1.4512903767638363e-08, 'VotingIntention': 8.89869724574055e-08}\",\n[[\"Al-Hubail\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"A/65/629\", \"Symbol\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"annual\", \"DATE\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"resolution 64/81\", \"R\"], [\"paragraph 5\", \"PARA\"], [\"19\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"third\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"120\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"four\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"secondly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"fourthly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Kuwait\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Compromise 20\", \"PARA\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 775,\n            'f': \"775\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 41,\n            'f': \"41\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999992847442627,\n            'f': \"0.9999992847442627\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Li Baodong (China) (spoke in Chinese): The Chinese delegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the culture of peace (A/65/269). In our present world, increasing globalization, the spread of information technologies and more frequent exchanges among peoples of different countries have brought civilizations ever closer to each other, creating favourable conditions for dialogue and cooperation among them. In the meantime, peace and development have yet to become a reality. New global challenges keep emerging; clashes between civilizations have intensified; misunderstandings among religions and cultures still exist; and religious and racial discrimination are far from being eliminated. Against such a background, it has become all the more important to strengthen dialogue and cooperation among civilizations. In recent years, the General Assembly has held a number of high-level meetings on intercultural and interfaith dialogue, which have highlighted the importance and urgency of cultural cooperation and emphasized the intrinsic links between dialogue among civilizations and peace and development. This momentum of cooperation should be maintained. At the same time, we should gain experience and learn lessons from these efforts, while identifying effective ways and best practices for enhancing the understanding, mutual trust and cooperation that can ensure concrete progress in this area. China believes that the following three points should be observed in conducting dialogue and cooperation among civilizations. First, we should respect each other and conduct dialogue as equals. Diversity is a basic feature of human civilization, as well as a common asset of human society. There are close to 200 countries in the world. Despite their differences in terms of social systems, levels of development, cultures, traditions and religious beliefs, all have contributed to human progress. It is therefore necessary for all countries to respect and learn from one another and live together in peace. Extremism, the imposition of beliefs or values on others, discrimination based on religious, racial or other grounds, bias, and xenophobia should be firmly rejected. Secondly, we must work on multiple fronts in order to achieve synergy. Culture and religion touch a wide range of areas and involve complex issues, so there can be no cookie-cutter approach to dialogue and cooperation in this regard. Within the United Nations, multiple initiatives and mechanisms, such as resolution 64/81 on the promotion of interreligious and intercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace, and the Alliance of Civilizations, have been launched. With their distinct features and advantages, those initiatives and mechanisms should strengthen communication and coordination among themselves. The United Nations should play an important role as a platform for cultural exchange and should enable the various initiatives and mechanisms to complement each other and grow side by side. Thirdly, we should involve all sectors of society and work for concrete results. Dialogue among different civilizations is ultimately about promoting people-to-people contact. It should thus not be limited to the national level. Rather, civil society, academia and the media should all be mobilized to disseminate the message of a culture of peace to communities and schools so as to bring the whole society on board. It is particularly important to convey a message of tolerance, understanding and respect to the youth so as to build up their capacity to resist religious hatred and discrimination. The media should conscientiously assume their social responsibility by upholding morality and contributing to the creation of an atmosphere of tolerance and understanding in society. China is a multi-ethnic and multireligious country. The Chinese civilization has been imbued with the concept of harmony throughout history. The Chinese Government adheres to the policy of freedom of religion, fully respects its citizens\\u2019 religious beliefs and safeguards that freedom with the Constitution and other laws. Different religions in China coexist in harmony and enjoy equal status. Religious and non-religious citizens respect each other and live together in harmony. Religious figures in China carry forward fine traditions of patriotism, religious devotion and philanthropy and actively participate in charity work and other public welfare undertakings, thus contributing to social harmony and stability. China favours cultural diversity and believes that different civilizations should learn from each other and seek common ground, while shelving differences, and should jointly contribute to the prosperity and progress of mankind. China actively supports dialogue and cooperation among civilizations and religions and has hosted major events to that end, such as the Asia- Europe Meeting Interfaith Dialogue and the World Buddhist Forum. In two weeks\\u2019 time, Expo 2010 Shanghai will draw to a close. As the first such global event hosted by a developing country in the history of world expos, it has attracted the participation of 246 countries and international organizations and over 60 million visitors over a period of five months. The Shanghai World Expo offers a platform for countries to demonstrate their cultural achievements and share development experience, giving full expression to the diversity of the world\\u2019s civilizations. It has become a showcase of cultural diversity and harmony and an event of happiness and friendship for all. The Chinese Government will further strengthen cultural dialogue and exchanges with other countries with a view to contributing to the creation of a world of lasting peace, common prosperity and harmony. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.0445974751860376e-08, 'ActionObject': 5.770784738956536e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 5.3729053206552635e-08, 'Body': 2.2697496659951355e-10, 'Clarification': 2.102908602807929e-08, 'Conclusion': 3.895499034456407e-09, 'Election': 5.448145401487636e-08, 'General': 0.9999992847442627, 'Introduction': 2.612888749808917e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 3.2070341937640023e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 1.2094174550725256e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 2.7715105765935277e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 1.6752431974964566e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 9.296763359145643e-09, 'OralStatement': 1.2039143904019056e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 5.885456566545599e-09, 'RVRequested': 3.0440175380341827e-10, 'RVTaken': 6.583291134454328e-10, 'Session': 4.182322044243847e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.881269806602859e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.4423979222708567e-09, 'Vote': 1.1198005189783089e-08, 'VotingIntention': 4.4238397833851195e-08}\",\n[[\"Li Baodong\", \"PERSON\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"A/65/269\", \"Symbol\"], [\"recent years\", \"DATE\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"three\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"First\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"200\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Secondly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"resolution 64/81\", \"R\"], [\"Thirdly\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"two weeks\", \"DATE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"246\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"over 60 million\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"a period of five months\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 776,\n            'f': \"776\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 42,\n            'f': \"42\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999822378158569,\n            'f': \"0.9999822378158569\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Ben\\u00edtez Vers\\u00f3n (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly declared the period 2001 to 2010 the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World (resolution 53/25). Today, as we face the end of the decade, we must frankly recognize that we have not met the goals we set for ourselves. Cuba considers strict respect for the United Nations Charter and its principles to be the fundamental basis for achieving a culture of peace. Peace is not only the absence of conflicts. Promoting a culture of peace requires the promotion of education at all levels, 21 sustainable economic and social development and respect for all human rights for all people. There cannot be a culture of peace unless understanding, tolerance and solidarity are promoted, along with respect for the history, diverse religions and individual character of each nation. Achieving a culture of peace requires respect for cultural diversity. We watch with concern some doctrines promoting the clash of civilizations, demonizing cultures and religions that are thousands of years old. Any doctrine based on racial or cultural superiority must be firmly rejected. Equally unacceptable is the intention of some to identify certain cultures and religions with terrorism and violence. To succeed in establishing a culture of peace, clear commitments and concrete actions to promote sustainable development and environmental protection are necessary. Obstacles to the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination must be also eliminated. There cannot be a culture of peace as long as the acquisition of territories through war is not recognized as unacceptable and some States act in ways contrary to the United Nations Charter and international law. A culture of peace is not promoted by threatening the sovereignty and independence of other nations. How can a culture of peace be achieved if, on one hand, annual military expenditures increase at a dizzying rate \\u2014 reaching the chilling figure of $1.531 trillion \\u2014 while, on the other hand, the number of hungry people reaches the record figure of 925 million \\u2014 nearly one sixth of the world\\u2019s population? The introduction of the study of different cultures and civilizations in educational curricula would be an excellent contribution to a culture of peace. The teaching of languages, history and the philosophies of civilizations could be also included. Mass media also have an important role in spreading human values. We must promote ethical conduct and responsibility on the part of the media, so that they contribute to mutual respect and dialogue among civilizations. Cuba supports the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace and the Global Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations and its Programme of Action. We also support UNESCO programmes and practical initiatives on this topic. A better world is possible. As wisely stated in the Constitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, \\u201csince wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed\\u201d. The solution lies in our hands. We must act without further delay so that a culture of peace and the Alliance among Civilizations finally prevail over the culture of violence and war. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.856758586882279e-07, 'ActionObject': 6.923268358605128e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 2.3465283902623923e-06, 'Body': 7.816291613949033e-09, 'Clarification': 2.4070075710369565e-07, 'Conclusion': 1.251908514632305e-07, 'Election': 5.85607494940632e-07, 'General': 0.9999822378158569, 'Introduction': 4.118316610401962e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.2206991800999276e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 2.379772610083819e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 6.659617213244928e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 8.115610398817807e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 1.7467534974002774e-07, 'OralStatement': 3.850871621580154e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.0946812523116023e-07, 'RVRequested': 1.226171431056855e-08, 'RVTaken': 2.4899033945757765e-08, 'Session': 7.473939689361941e-08, 'Sponsorship': 1.4480990628840118e-08, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 7.550106317921745e-08, 'Vote': 5.4030270035809735e-08, 'VotingIntention': 7.349058250838425e-07}\",\n[[\"Ben\\u00edtez Vers\\u00f3n\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Cuba\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the period 2001 to 2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolution 53/25\", \"R\"], [\"Today\", \"DATE\"], [\"the end of the decade\", \"DATE\"], [\"Cuba\", \"UNPE\"], [\"21\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"thousands of years old\", \"DATE\"], [\"annual\", \"DATE\"], [\"925 million\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"nearly one sixth\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Cuba\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 777,\n            'f': \"777\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 43,\n            'f': \"43\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999998807907104,\n            'f': \"0.9999998807907104\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): Let me begin by thanking the Secretary-General for his report on intercultural, interreligious and intercivilizational dialogue (A/65/269). We are also grateful for the report of the Director-General of UNESCO on the activities carried out during the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World, 2001-2010 (see A/65/299). Indonesia welcomes and commends the role of the various United Nations entities in supporting intercultural, interreligious and intercivilizational cooperation worldwide. Indonesia is also deeply appreciative of the work of the Tripartite Forum on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace and the Alliance of Civilizations to promote a culture of peace. Efforts to promote a culture of peace represent an important part of the interaction among all cultures and civilizations. Dialogue and cooperation among peoples, cultures, religions, faiths and civilizations are essential for the growth of a global culture of peace. There is no doubt that much of the future of humankind depends on peaceful coexistence and cooperation among civilizations, cultures and religions. Unfortunately, religious hatred and intolerance, rather than diminishing, are on the increase. In the face of the recent polarization among peoples, as faith-based discrimination and racism were seen to be on the rise, we continue to believe that what unites us is much greater than what divides us. In our view, there is always room to nurture and celebrate our common values. It is our responsibility to ensure that the world\\u2019s rich cultural diversity is appreciated as the divine blessing that it is. That diversity is the invaluable collective heritage of humankind, which we ought to celebrate and treasure. In order to turn our diversity to our advantage, we need to scale up efforts to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 22 intolerance, including discrimination against persons based on their religion and beliefs. In our much more connected world today, action by a small and distant group can inflict significant damage upon all the international community. As we saw only recently, religious radicalism by a local religious minority leader is capable of causing considerable damage to global interfaith harmony and world peace. Indonesia would therefore like to see efforts to promote a culture of peace focusing more on the minority elements at strategic social levels, particularly those who lead groups of people. In that connection, we are concerned about the absence of a multilaterally negotiated instrument containing normative standards that can help diffuse religious radicalism. It is an ideal which we should work towards establishing. Indonesia is firmly committed to promoting a culture of peace. We keenly support initiatives that deal with the challenges of cultural diversity, as they are very much in line with what we are already doing in Indonesia. Dialogue and mutual accommodation among faiths and cultures have featured prominently in Indonesia\\u2019s history. That is how we have woven, from the many strands of our ethnic cultures and traditions, the single fabric of our nationhood. In Indonesia, dialogue is a prominent tool for ensuring harmony and peaceful living among the various communal groups and for ensuring stability and promoting development at the national level. Moreover, we empower the moderates whose voices would otherwise be drowned by the agitation of extremists. In Indonesia, we are also organizing interfaith and intercultural dialogue at the regional, interregional and global levels. We have organized such dialogue in tandem with other Governments, international organizations, civil society and the mass media. Here, at the United Nations, we have consistently supported all resolutions on the agenda item \\u201cCulture of peace\\u201d. Indonesia also attaches great significance to the initiatives of Member States to promote respect for diversity, freedom, justice and tolerance. All such existing initiatives in interfaith, intercultural and intercivilizational dialogue have become part of a global network aimed at promoting peace and harmony. However, it is important to point out that even all those undertakings are not enough if they remain only within conference halls. We must therefore recognize that, indeed, dialogue is not an end in itself. All those dialogues going on all over the world today will amount to nothing if they do not lead to cooperative action at the grass-roots level. It is our responsibility to ensure that those dialogues lead to the development of communities that work for the welfare of their fellow human beings, while enlightening one another on the need for mutual understanding and mutual appreciation. Dialogue should foster communities that take on a positive role in the life of the nation by encouraging and inspiring the Government to adhere to democratic principles and to promote and protect human rights and individual freedoms, regardless of ethnicity or religion. It should lead to communities that appreciate the unique qualities and perspectives of other peoples. If all nations can nurture such communities, then we are well on our way to developing a global culture of peace. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.0242979797681073e-08, 'ActionObject': 8.080145441624609e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 2.018987999008459e-08, 'Body': 7.255183953613908e-11, 'Clarification': 1.6905994826288406e-08, 'Conclusion': 1.0196172794962877e-09, 'Election': 1.6124706903042352e-08, 'General': 0.9999998807907104, 'Introduction': 1.106666971395498e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.149409317198092e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 4.346972559687856e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 7.282526803820133e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 3.133326487159138e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 5.303264938305574e-09, 'OralStatement': 7.157042070105035e-09, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.7256593365952995e-09, 'RVRequested': 7.732993412279399e-11, 'RVTaken': 2.0661038158120704e-10, 'Session': 9.413404500335787e-10, 'Sponsorship': 8.1679524255307e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.1859452026262716e-09, 'Vote': 3.1705977843188293e-09, 'VotingIntention': 2.369118234923917e-08}\",\n[[\"Kleib\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"A/65/269\", \"Symbol\"], [\"2001-2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"A/65/299\", \"Symbol\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"22\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"\\u201cCulture of peace\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 778,\n            'f': \"778\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 44,\n            'f': \"44\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999924898147583,\n            'f': \"0.9999924898147583\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Cabactulan (Philippines): At the outset, I would like to extend the gratitude of the Republic of the Philippines to the President for his able leadership of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. As the community of nations moves forward in pursuit of our common goals of lasting peace, progress and prosperity, may I express the firm commitment of the Philippines to work closely with him and our partners in order to achieve our shared vision for ourselves and our posterity. We meet at a time of great opportunities and many challenges. Technological developments, all made at a breakneck pace, bring the bright promise of our peoples being drawn ever closer together. Yet even as we see different peoples and communities coming together in the spirit of understanding and charity with the message of peace and coexistence, there are those who seek to break the bonds of goodwill that have brought many peoples together. For those dark elements seek to inflict pain and suffering, to foster rancour and resentment, and to force violence and fear upon the world. It is regrettable that our people have to endure violence in its many malevolent forms. Peoples are broken further apart by those who seek to sow confusion, doubt and suspicion. There are those who 23 prey on the disenfranchised and the marginalized and surreptitiously use the faith, culture and religion of others to push and justify their own dark agenda. Faith, culture and religion have been turned against themselves and used to drive people to despair and to perform acts of violence. The Philippines joins other nations in condemning those acts in all their forms and manifestations. The Philippines likewise asserts that such acts should not be associated in any way with any culture, faith or religion. For the Philippines and, indeed, for the rest of the world, faith, culture and religion rightly give millions of people hope in this world, the will to treat others like themselves, and the impetus to work with others towards a more inclusive and more understanding world. That abiding belief has moved us to harness the world community\\u2019s collective strength to further strengthen the foundations of a world respectful of humanity\\u2019s diversity. Civil strife in the southern Philippines brought out the importance of interfaith dialogue in the promotion of understanding, peace, cooperation and development among stakeholders. In that same spirit, Mindanao will once again commemorate its annual Week of Peace, begun in the mid 1990s. Our work continues to this day, with interfaith dialogue and reconciliation remaining key features of the Philippine medium-term development plan. Seeking to engage the world community in that endeavour, in 2004 the Philippines initiated resolution 59/23, on the promotion of interreligious dialogue. That resolution proved to be a landmark in that it opened the portals of the United Nations to interfaith partnerships and cooperation in the cause of justice and peace. Since then, we have seen a series of resolutions on interfaith, interreligious and intercivilizational dialogue approved by consensus: resolution 60/10, entitled \\u201cPromotion of interreligious dialogue and cooperation for peace\\u201d; resolutions 61/221, 62/90 and 63/22, jointly introduced by the Philippines and Pakistan from 2006 to 2008; and resolution 64/81, also jointly presented by the Philippines and Pakistan, on the promotion of interreligious and intercultural cooperation for peace. The concrete outcomes of those resolutions include the holding by the General Assembly of the High-Level Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace; the designation of the Office for Economic and Social Council Support and Coordination in the Department of Economic and Social Affairs as the focal unit in the Secretariat to handle, within the United Nations system, all interreligious, intercultural and intercivilizational matters; and the proclamation of 2010 as the International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures. A core group of 16 countries, 3 United Nations bodies and the 110-member Committee of Religious Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) at the United Nations was formed, leading to the holding in 2005 of the Conference on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace at United Nations Headquarters. That became the troika of the Tripartite Forum on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace, which has now grown to include 55 Governments, 15 United Nations agencies and 110 religious NGOs at the United Nations. It has developed a new paradigm of understanding and cooperation, which is described as faith-fuelled and love-inspired. Likewise, an informal summit of like-minded world leaders met in 2005 on the sidelines of the General Assembly and adopted a declaration urging efforts for interreligious, intercultural and intercivilizational dialogue and cooperation. We have postponed the similar informal summit scheduled for this year until next year so that it can be immediately preceded by a ministerial meeting. Beyond these positive developments at the United Nations, five Asia-Pacific Regional Interfaith Dialogues have been held: in Jakarta; Cebu, Philippines; Waitangi, New Zealand; Phnom Penh; and Perth, Australia. Between regions, we have had six interfaith dialogues in the Asia-Europe Meeting: in Bali, Indonesia; Larnaca, Cyprus; Nanjing, China; and in Amsterdam, Seoul and Madrid. The following have also been held: the third Global Inter-Media Dialogue, in Bali; the World Conference on Dialogue, in Madrid; the sixth general meeting of the World Public Forum \\u201cDialogue of Civilization\\u201d, in Rhodes, Greece; the second Alliance of Civilizations Forum, in Istanbul, Turkey; the 2009 Parliament of the World\\u2019s Religions, in Melbourne, 24 Australia; and the third Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions, in Astana. In a clear demonstration of its commitment to the cause of interfaith dialogue, the Philippines hosted the special Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) ministerial meeting on interfaith dialogue and cooperation for peace in Manila in December 2009. Espoused by 118 member countries of the NAM, it was the first movement of its kind that mainstreamed civil society, particularly the religious and faith organizations, as governmental partners in such vital areas as peace and development. Those and other efforts have been documented in a book entitled Peace through Interfaith Dialogue: Philippine Diplomacy and the Promotion of Mutual Understanding, Respect and Tolerance. We are pleased to provide copies of this book to the members of the Assembly. In April 2010, I was honoured to join the special event marking the commemoration of 2010 as the International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures. Held just ahead of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which the Philippines chaired, the event was a fitting capstone to what we have worked so hard to achieve all these years. But our work is not yet done. Sustaining the momentum is vital, as is engaging all stakeholders in the interfaith dialogue process. The push and pull between those who stand together for dialogue, tolerance, understanding and respect, on the one hand, and those who seek the fall of all into the abyss of suspicion, bigotry, confusion and violence, on the other hand, continues. We must continue moving forward together. For its part, the Philippines will continue to work closely with and consult our partners on the tabling of another draft resolution on the agenda item on the culture of peace. We seek to further expand interfaith dialogue to include, inter alia, dialogue with indigenous peoples. We must ensure that, on the road to greater peace and development, dialogue is as inclusive and broad as possible. As we welcome the introduction of Jordan\\u2019s draft resolution on the holding of World Interfaith Harmony Week (A/65/L.5) as a reminder of our continuing duties, we will consult with our co-sponsors on the best way forward on the proposal for a decade of interreligious dialogue as we await the report of the Secretary-General on the matter at the sixty-sixth session. We encourage all Member States to submit their comments on the Secretary-General\\u2019s report concerning the issue. We also urge all Member States to participate actively in the efforts to foster interfaith dialogue. The road ahead of us and the journey forward remain long. However, we are confident that we will reach our destination, with every milestone that we achieve. Fully resolved to turn our vision into reality, we will forge on undeterred, learning from each other, understanding one another and respecting others as we respect ourselves. \",\n\"{'Action': 2.61947263879847e-07, 'ActionObject': 2.4046434532465355e-07, 'AgendaStatus': 3.4340888532824465e-07, 'Body': 6.132963914495804e-09, 'Clarification': 3.5193633607377706e-07, 'Conclusion': 5.766413124774772e-08, 'Election': 2.8037894139743e-07, 'General': 0.9999924898147583, 'Introduction': 1.2039740795444231e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 4.751100490807403e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 1.1881505201927212e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 2.0112590704002287e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 2.33317928177712e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 7.695692971765311e-08, 'OralStatement': 6.197893753778771e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 6.060682977704346e-08, 'RVRequested': 3.5707339307577968e-09, 'RVTaken': 1.645309488651492e-08, 'Session': 3.985891083857496e-08, 'Sponsorship': 1.429246765383141e-07, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.1903690477765849e-07, 'Vote': 6.079323355834276e-08, 'VotingIntention': 9.739857205204316e-07}\",\n[[\"Cabactulan\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Philippines\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the Republic of the Philippines\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Philippines\", \"UNPE\"], [\"23\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Philippines\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Philippines\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Philippines\", \"UNPE\"], [\"millions\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Philippines\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the mid 1990s\", \"DATE\"], [\"this day\", \"DATE\"], [\"2004\", \"DATE\"], [\"Philippines\", \"UNPE\"], [\"resolution 59/23\", \"R\"], [\"resolution 60/10\", \"R\"], [\"entitled \\u201cPromotion of interreligious dialogue and cooperation for peace\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"resolutions 61/221\", \"R\"], [\"62/90\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"63/22\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Philippines\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Pakistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2006\", \"DATE\"], [\"2008\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolution 64/81\", \"R\"], [\"Philippines\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Pakistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"16\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"3\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2005\", \"DATE\"], [\"55\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"15\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"110\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2005\", \"DATE\"], [\"this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"next year\", \"DATE\"], [\"five\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Dialogues\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Philippines\", \"UNPE\"], [\"New Zealand\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Australia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"six\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Indonesia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Cyprus\", \"UNPE\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"third\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"sixth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"\\u201cDialogue of Civilization\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"Greece\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Turkey\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2009\", \"DATE\"], [\"24\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Australia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"third\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Philippines\", \"UNPE\"], [\"December 2009\", \"DATE\"], [\"118\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"April 2010\", \"PARA\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"Philippines\", \"UNPE\"], [\"all these years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Philippines\", \"UNPE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"Jordan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"], [\"A/65/L.5\", \"L\"], [\"a decade\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 779,\n            'f': \"779\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 45,\n            'f': \"45\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999978542327881,\n            'f': \"0.9999978542327881\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Dos Santos (Paraguay) (spoke in Spanish): I would like to express the gratitude of the Government of Paraguay for the preparation of the Secretary- General\\u2019s report on agenda item 15, \\u201cCulture of peace\\u201d (A/65/269), and his note transmitting the report of the UNESCO Director-General (A/65/299). We are sure they will contribute to our debate today. The delegation of Paraguay would like to speak once again in support of the culture of peace. We want to resolutely cooperate to achieve the noble objective of the United Nations and its Members: achieving a broad and deep understanding among the various cultures. For that, we have endorsed and will continue to support enthusiastically the initiatives for a dialogue between different peoples, Governments and religions. Humankind is unique in its origins but diverse in its cultural manifestations. The only way for it to overcome the injustice and violence afflicting it is through dialogue. Dialogue must be based on accepting diversity. In violence, unlike dialogue, there is no acceptance. There is only the elimination of different ideas, or at least an attempt to do so. Dialogue will be dialogue only if we accept \\u2014 or better yet, tolerate \\u2014 the cultural and religious differences that identify each community and each nation but that, ultimately, are the inseparable elements that make up humankind. In order to promote the dialogue between cultures and civilizations, my delegation wishes to propose that the United Nations proclaim 30 July of each year World Friendship Day, to contribute to building a more fraternal global society, thus fostering the culture of peace, respect and mutual acceptance at the international level, without any kind of distinction or discrimination. This initiative, which has been a 25 tradition in my country for over 50 years, has the institutional support of the Government. It was circulated in document A/64/883 at the previous Assembly session and was announced in the Hall during the general debate of the current session by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of my country as a proposal to renew mutual appreciation and recognition between our peoples (see A/65/PV.23). Appropriately, our delegation will conduct the relevant consultations with the various countries and regional groups in order to present shortly a draft resolution that proclaims the World Friendship Day. I would like to request all delegations to lend their support to this initiative so that it will meet with success. \",\n\"{'Action': 4.975548151264775e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.1807237854100094e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 1.6121114754241717e-07, 'Body': 5.872314301491599e-10, 'Clarification': 6.193646129304398e-08, 'Conclusion': 1.5058976288173653e-08, 'Election': 7.949660130179836e-08, 'General': 0.9999978542327881, 'Introduction': 1.2274132359380019e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 4.930078567610963e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 3.404230142223241e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 4.25132284931351e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 1.815272128169454e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 4.48614265735614e-08, 'OralStatement': 2.1761655588647955e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.648892032970252e-08, 'RVRequested': 1.0084497681361881e-09, 'RVTaken': 2.0419403945481918e-09, 'Session': 8.919610827717861e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.9564507791614005e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.203095578716784e-08, 'Vote': 2.2772375984914106e-08, 'VotingIntention': 1.4725523556080589e-07}\",\n[[\"Dos Santos\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Paraguay\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Paraguay\", \"UNPE\"], [\"agenda item 15\", \"AI\"], [\"\\u201cCulture of peace\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"A/65/269\", \"Symbol\"], [\"A/65/299\", \"Symbol\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Paraguay\", \"UNPE\"], [\"proclaim 30\", \"PARA\"], [\"25\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"over 50 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"A/64/883\", \"Symbol\"], [\"draft resolution\", \"DR\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 780,\n            'f': \"780\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 46,\n            'f': \"46\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999830722808838,\n            'f': \"0.9999830722808838\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Salsabili (Islamic Republic of Iran): We are here today for a joint debate on two interrelated agenda items in order to follow up on the progress of our work on the enhanced promotion of a culture of peace and the Global Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations through interreligious, intercultural and intercivilizational dialogue and cooperation. Let me thank the Secretary-General and the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for all of their efforts to prepare the two thought-provoking reports contained in documents A/65/269 and A/65/299 on these two very significant items on the agenda of the General Assembly. Cultural diversity as the centrepiece of the two agenda items \\u2014 \\u201cGlobal Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations\\u201d and \\u201cCulture of peace\\u201d \\u2014 is thoroughly discussed and reflected in these two reports as a real and basic fact of today\\u2019s regional and international relations. Such a fundamental fact should not be seen as a barrier to our collective endeavour to advance dialogue and understanding. Respect for cultural diversity at the national and international levels and recognition of the fact that cultural diversity is a source of unity rather than division within the international community will indeed promote peace and security. Thus, cultural diversity is an asset that enriches the common human cultural heritage. Hence, continued cultural domination through policies of cultural hegemony and efforts to eliminate cultural identities through the globalization process will result in major setbacks to the promotion of human rights, international cooperation and the mutual enrichment of the cultural life of humankind. 26 On the other hand, respect for and understanding of others could be considered key elements in enhancing international cooperation. The practice of listening to others rather than confronting or offending them should be cultivated and promoted as a culture among actors at all levels of international politics. Globalization as a process can pose challenges and create opportunities in this domain. Repressive measures in the increasingly globalized world could take the form of disinformation through the global media and modern communication technologies. Religious intolerance, including Islamophobia, created as a result of aggressive media policies, seeks to demonize particular cultures and religions and can lead ultimately to hatred and exclusion. This should be prevented through an innovative and alternative plan for international cooperation among all nations. We believe that diversity is necessary for humankind to flourish. We should resist the perceptions and temptations that set individual against individual, group against group and nation against nation. Above all, ways to eliminate the defamation of religions and discrimination based on religion or belief should be deliberated. Religious intolerance, the spreading of hatred, xenophobia and racial discrimination are but a few examples of issues long faced by the international community. Many of us have voiced our vehement condemnation of the defamation of religions, yet we have continued to witness instances of poisonous actions against certain religions and their sacred books, beliefs and followers. The recent attempt to put the Koran, the most sacred book of each and every one of the more than 1.6 billion Muslims of the world, into a fire was a clear example of such a crime. Such actions should be duly dealt with by States. This alarming act was also a warning against the rising trend of discriminatory national laws and policies adopted and implemented against any religion. Attempts to stigmatize groups of people \\u2014 in particular, people of certain ethnicities and religious minorities \\u2014 on the basis of their religion under various pretexts related to issues of security and illegal immigration are among the major obstacles to our approach to respect cultural diversity. One way to respond could be to enhance the cultural policies of Member States at the national and regional levels in order to strengthen respect for cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue in practical terms. The Non-Aligned Movement Centre for Human Rights and Cultural Diversity in Tehran has been established and is actively contributing to the promotion of such an idea. Besides honouring the events marking the commemoration of 2010 as the International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures, one of the other practical achievements in the process of promoting cultural diversity as a means of cooperation to enhance peace among different nations is respect for traditional common cultures. On 23 February, the General Assembly unanimously adopted resolution 64/253, entitled \\u201cInternational Day of Nowruz\\u201d. The resolution was the fruit of joint efforts by eight Member States, including the Islamic Republic of Iran. While the resolution reaffirms the purposes and principles of the Charter, in particular the achievements of international cooperation in the economic, social and cultural fields \\u2014 including, inter alia, resolution 56/6, on the Global Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations; the Declaration of the Principles of International Cultural Cooperation, and the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, adopted by UNESCO \\u2014 it also underlines the appeal for greater solidarity on the basis of recognition of cultural diversity, of awareness of the unity of humankind and of the development of intercultural exchanges. It emphasizes the need to achieve an objective understanding of all civilizations and to enhance constructive interaction and cooperative engagement among civilizations by playing a major role in strengthening the ties among peoples based on mutual respect and the ideals of peace and good- neighbourliness. Nowruz traditions and rituals reflect the ancient cultural customs of the civilizations of East and West that have influenced those civilizations through the interchange of human values. Finally, let me confirm the fact that the promotion of dialogue among civilizations and cultures is a key component of UNESCO\\u2019s mission and activities and has led that organization to shoulder a significant portion of that task. With this in mind, my delegation will spare no effort in cooperating at the next meeting of the UNESCO High Panel on Peace and Dialogue among Cultures, which will be convened by the Director-General of UNESCO within the next two months at United Nations Headquarters here in New York to identify new avenues and modalities for future action. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.5752243598399218e-07, 'ActionObject': 5.209789222249128e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 1.389834210385743e-06, 'Body': 5.386338930435386e-09, 'Clarification': 1.369798212635942e-07, 'Conclusion': 5.991869045374187e-08, 'Election': 4.322687345847953e-07, 'General': 0.9999830722808838, 'Introduction': 4.2551282604108565e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.328182630544461e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 1.5647196960344445e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 4.3016374462467866e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 9.17994293558877e-06, 'MeetingStatus': 1.002477318934325e-07, 'OralStatement': 1.5188624047368648e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 7.674863411466504e-08, 'RVRequested': 7.941460822280533e-09, 'RVTaken': 1.3236785001424778e-08, 'Session': 4.970598865838838e-08, 'Sponsorship': 8.682286889438728e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 6.533904439720573e-08, 'Vote': 3.9346637947801355e-08, 'VotingIntention': 4.361994854207296e-07}\",\n[[\"Salsabili\", \"PERSON\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"A/65/269\", \"Symbol\"], [\"A/65/299\", \"Symbol\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"\\u201cGlobal Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations\\u201d and \\u201cCulture of peace\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"One\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2010\", \"DATE\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"23 February\", \"DATE\"], [\"resolution 64/253\", \"R\"], [\"entitled \\u201cInternational Day of Nowruz\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"eight\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the Islamic Republic of Iran\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Charter\", \"PERSON\"], [\"resolution 56/6\", \"R\"], [\"Nowruz\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the next two months\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 781,\n            'f': \"781\",\n        },\n\"A_65_PV.32-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 47,\n            'f': \"47\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 1.0,\n            'f': \"1.0\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Mr. Haroon (Pakistan): I thank the President for convening this very important debate of the General Assembly this morning. From the attendance here, one can be absolutely sure that peace does not have as large a following in the Assembly as the elections did a few days ago, when there was only standing room here. And of course, as we know, anything that is contentious is bound to lead away from, and not towards, peace. So, judging by the visuals here today, I fear that we have a long way to go in pursuing this matter of introducing the culture of peace. I am not terribly sure whether, by not including the culture of peace in the Millennium Development Goals, we have done something good for this institution or not. But, surely, this matter is very important. We start off by citing anything that becomes contentious as a danger to peace, but I think that there is much more to it than that. There will always be divisive policies, ideologies and the belief that might is right to inflict upon others what concerns people about their way of life. I think the greatest hindrance to anything cogent emerging is that, when we sit in this Hall, we all speak of our ways, our countries, our delegations and our groups. If we continue to do that, I am not terribly sure that peace will prevail. There may be outward calm and there may be a lot that is not said out of respect for each others\\u2019 feelings, but certainly peace will not prevail in the world or in this Hall, other than in outward appearance. The Charter of the Organization has enunciated the principles of practising tolerance, living together in peace with one another as good neighbours, uniting our strengths to maintain international peace and security and promoting social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. I think that the moment the Charter spells out the concept of good neighbours, it seems like an exclusion or preclusion of those beyond our boundaries who consider themselves to be impregnable or invulnerable as sovereign States. Peace should not be just the extension of good- neighbourly relationships; it should go beyond and exist as a culture. That is what we are saying here today. I find that the Charter is not sufficient. It is in fact deficient in the proclamation of what we are trying to achieve. In 1999, we reaffirmed our intention to continue to work to achieve peaceful coexistence in line with the United Nations Charter. That was a declaration based 27 on the principles of multilateral cooperation, respect for life, the promotion and practice of non-violence through education, dialogue, cooperation and commitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes. Now, as far as the peaceful settlement of disputes is concerned, I am afraid that nowhere in the world \\u2014 judging from the fact that accidents taking place on narrow streets can be the pretext for small-scale, or even large-scale, rioting \\u2014 have we really even conceived of a culture that would promote peace instead. And history has proven that no trauma that follows such disputes can be resolved by a peaceful ending. Some of the greatest changes in history have taken place on the backs of disputes that have changed the way humankind thinks. They have changed the way the Earth is progressing towards a better future. I am afraid that that culture cannot be born out of a lack of dispute when disputes are settled with verbiage that cannot be understood by those who sign the documents. These things will have to be resolved in their own fashion. It is that resolution which leads to change, not the words spelled out in a document. I know that we have a common set of universal values. Peace is the core message of all religions. It is not war alone that challenges peace, but it is one of the primary indicators of lack of peace. The first introduction of war on this planet was, in fact, at the beginning of the new age that started in the first century, when Judaism was joined first by Christianity, and later with Islam. The monotheistic religions on record have produced more wars and more suffering in history than anything else before them, yet the profession of faith is based upon peace. So we have to understand that it is peace that we seek. The culture of this peace is not easily definable. If Charles I of England had not abrogated Parliament and sent the Rump Parliament home, the changes that brought democracy and the Commonwealth to England might never have taken place. Yet from that catharsis and that trauma grew a very serious pledge to steer the world towards better peace. Unfortunately, religion keeps a strong grip on hate. Hate is a very strong weapon in the hands of different faiths, and it is being used mercilessly. The complete killing of the Mayan culture in Central America was based not on a profession of peace and love, but upon hate and the extermination of an entire 28 culture \\u2014 not just the extermination of the people, but the burning of their famous libraries, which many now believe to have been the largest repositories of world science, education and history. Today we see in various parts of the world all sorts of misunderstandings that are again based on faith. We had a recent expression of it here in America, where hate was again put forward in an attempt to create Samuel Huntington\\u2019s clash of civilizations. I feel that we are very lucky that due cognizance was taken, and I say this with a great amount of respect for many organizations, not only the American Government but the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which kept a harness on the issue and brought it to its due end. We need to stand together to decry those who, in the name of faith, extend agendas that are no longer acceptable to the people of this world. Finding common ground is certainly important, but I feel that, more than that, among the great things that are needed, one would be education. A second would be an easily available, honest and sincere approach to justice. To my mind, the third would be the acceptance of a common agenda in all constitutions of the world that profess and express the need for a culture of peace as a preamble and a necessity \\u2014 not mere lip service, but an understanding of its implications. We should pass it into law. I would say that, when we co-sponsored interfaith harmony in the General Assembly with the Philippines; when we speak in many ways in the Assembly; and, of late, when I see my colleagues from the Indian desk sitting here, we have gone a long way in trying to promote understanding. That understanding manifested itself beautifully in the recent tennis finals of the most senior tournament in the world today, the US Open, where it was important, I believe, for India and Pakistan to show the world that we could move towards peace as well. We recognize the growing need to promote harmony in all its manifestations, and we believe that we must take away challenge and replace it with acceptance. We should take away harassment and replace it with tolerance. We should take away hatred and bring it towards understanding. Cooperation, not the clash of civilizations, must be the paradigm for our future on this planet. In order to make this world a better place for our children, we should share the responsibility to highlight and propagate our common values of peace, tolerance, equality and sharing \\u2014 which we have forgotten \\u2014 and a respect for humanity. We should encourage the next generation to use education and exchange not only to adapt to modernity, but to use modernity and technology to change the world into a better and more peaceful place for all. \",\n\"{'Action': 6.940162888824375e-10, 'ActionObject': 2.021463690882186e-10, 'AgendaStatus': 7.221432340998035e-10, 'Body': 1.8290967698786353e-12, 'Clarification': 1.6311598738383282e-09,

Assembly; Secretary-General; Heads of State and Government, For many years, the General Assembly has discussed cooperation, dialogue, solidarity, the importance of progress in science and technology and ending poverty in the world. It has also discussed the urgent need of strengthening the Organization and multilateralism. The pandemic, which is affecting the planet, has made it hight time to turn those good intentions into more meaningful actions. COVID-19 has put every pressure to bear on multilateralism. Six months after it began, we are dealing not only with a health emergency, but also a social and economic one. Without exception, every country has been hit by the deadly virus. We will not be able to save lives and revive the economy without the support of multilateral organizations, private enterprise, the academic community and society, as a whole. For Ecuador, the support of international financial agencies has been key these past months. That is why we commend the calls for a multilateral response to the crisis. The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund recognizes the importance of supporting emerging and developing economies, and the President of the World Bank is talking about a debt moratorium for poor countries. Ecuador supports and appreciates those proposals and calls for middle-income countries to be taken into account, as every nation is facing serious economic problems. Dear friends, COVID-19 has historically changed the world today and, in all probability, its future. Poverty, inequality and unemployment will worsen, which will have an impact on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. We risk backsliding with regard to the gains made over the past few years. Ecuador\\u2019s national development plan \\u2014 Lifetime \\u2014 which we have not been remiss in implementing, is aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We firmly believe in the need for a strong, solid and committed multilateral system that ensures financial and technical support to all. The pandemic has shown that technology is key to guaranteeing citizens\\u2019 rights, such as access to remote health care, education and work. But it has also shown the great digital divide that exists among our nations, which is a product of inequality. The post-COVID era will pose for us the challenge of reviving economies and focusing on small- and medium-sized businesses, which create thousands upon thousands of jobs. It is necessary to offer flexible and sufficient lines of credit with acceptable terms, as well. But it is also imperative to meet the commitments of official development assistance. Colleagues from around the world, my country underscores the work of the World Health Organization and its leadership during this crisis. That is why we support the COVAX Facility initiative, to step up access to COVID-19 vaccines and the repository of technologies to combat the pandemic. Only in this way will we be able to enjoy fairly distributed patent-free vaccines, with special attention afforded the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people. The pandemic has affected us all, but its impact has been most severe on vulnerable groups. In addition to COVID-19 itself, the lockdown, the lack of employment and poverty have exacerbated gender-based violence. Women and children have had to stay at home with their abusers, risking their physical and mental safety and sometimes even their lives! Older adults and people with disabilities are also suffering disproportionately from the crisis because of their increased risk of infection. In Ecuador we have provided welfare vouchers, mobility and self-care assistance and, in many cases, decent housing at no cost. Together with 145 Member States we endorsed the policy brief, entitled \\u201cA Disability-inclusive response to COVID-19\\u201d. Likewise, we recognize the vulnerability of indigenous peoples. We must give them priority attention commensurate with their circumstances, and we must guarantee them access to treatments and vaccines. Migrants have also been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. As a host country, Ecuador seeks to guarantee the exercise of their rights with a humanitarian response. We will continue to firmly support the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, as well as the full implementation of the Declaration of Quito on Human Mobility of Venezuelan Citizens in the Region. Fellow Presidents, the sustainable use of natural resources and climate change is an issue that we cannot ignore. The failure to implement environmental agreements has very serious economic and social repercussions. Ecuador recently expressed its concern about the presence of a large foreign fishing fleet, which since May 2020 has been operating in very close proximity to the Galapagos Islands. We have reiterated that, without distinction of the flag, we will ensure that our maritime rights prevail over the exclusive economic zone. We are aware of the enormous responsibility to protect the Galapagos, which was designated as humankind\\u2019s first Natural World Heritage site. We call on the countries that fish in the waters of the south-east Pacific to self- regulate and limit their activities. We, the members of the Permanent Commission for the South Pacific, namely, the brotherly countries of Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, condemn illegal fishing in areas adjacent to our countries\\u2019 waters. We have also agreed to strengthen sharing information on the location of vessels in order to improve monitoring and surveillance. Ecuador therefore reaffirms its commitment to conserve the marine environment. As a demonstration of that, on 11 August, we joined the Global Ocean Alliance. The initiative, led by the United Kingdom, seeks to designate 30 per cent of the world\\u2019s oceans as marine protected areas. We are also committed to the conservation of the Amazon. We subscribe to the Leticia Declaration and what is known as the Financing Initiative for Sustainable Development and Bio-Economy for the Amazon. With the establishment of the multi-donor fund, administered by the IDB, significant resources will be allocated to conserve what are the lungs of the planet and improve the quality of life of indigenous peoples. We are facing new challenges the solution to which lies in unity and peace, not conflict. Recently, 172 countries supported the call of the Secretary-General for a global ceasefire and silencing all weapons. We are confident that the call and the relevant Security Council resolution (Security Council resolution 2532 (2020)) will serve as a first step towards achieving definitive and sustainable peace throughout the world. Today, our obligation is to join our efforts and fight the pandemic. For now, that is our common enemy! Recently, the commemoration of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki served to remind us of the devastating consequences of nuclear weapons. We therefore welcome the forthcoming entry into force of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. The pandemic must serve as an additional reason to step up disarmament obligations and make available the needed resources for revitalization. Friends and Heads of State and Government, I conclude by stressing that Ecuador firmly supports the initiative to move forward meaningful reform of the UN system. It is necessary to ensure greater accountability and maximize its efficiency. It is imperative to overhaul the system that we created at the end of the Second World War, as it does not reflect today\\u2019s reality. It is also important to guarantee the allocation of funds, to which end States must fulfil their obligation to contribute to the Organization without conditions or threats. Today, our peoples demand cooperation so we will be able to face the economic and social challenges of the post-COVID-19 era. Only together will we be able to win this cruel war, a cruel war that has already taken the lives of nearly 1 million people. Dear friends, I hope that, in the very near future, we will be able to give one another the fraternal hug that we owe another inside and outside our countries. Thank you very much. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.413424310925393e-08, 'ActionObject': 6.845558342405411e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 3.515314617175136e-08, 'Body': 1.1983351810851417e-10, 'Clarification': 3.4697247741632964e-08, 'Conclusion': 3.2902782720611867e-09, 'Election': 2.572747348494886e-08, 'General': 0.9999996423721313, 'Introduction': 1.654285455288118e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 3.799009995475444e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 9.681000889827374e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 1.1678245037671786e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 2.143710808866217e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 1.3423957057057123e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.237805591358665e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 8.728672895585987e-09, 'RVRequested': 1.599224780379771e-10, 'RVTaken': 4.951326570967751e-10, 'Session': 2.1486055157282635e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.400528804040846e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.0052182964368512e-09, 'Vote': 9.585218840868492e-09, 'VotingIntention': 5.681310710770049e-08}\",\n[[\"Lenin Moreno Garc\\u00e9s\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the Republic of Ecuador\", \"UNPE\"], [\"many years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Six months\", \"DATE\"], [\"as a whole\", \"DR_MOD\"], [\"Ecuador\", \"UNPE\"], [\"these past months\", \"DATE\"], [\"Ecuador\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"the past few years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Ecuador\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2030\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"thousands upon thousands\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Ecuador\", \"UNPE\"], [\"145\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"entitled \\u201cA Disability-inclusive response to COVID-19\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"Ecuador\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Ecuador\", \"UNPE\"], [\"May 2020\", \"DATE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Chile\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Colombia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Ecuador\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Peru\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Ecuador\", \"UNPE\"], [\"11 August\", \"DATE\"], [\"United Kingdom\", \"UNPE\"], [\"172\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"resolution 2532\", \"R\"], [\"2020\", \"DATE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Ecuador\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the end of the\", \"DATE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Today\", \"DATE\"], [\"nearly 1 million\", \"CARDINAL\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 877,\n            'f': \"877\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.7-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 94,\n            'f': \"94\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9996117949485779,\n            'f': \"0.9996117949485779\",\n        },\n\"ActionObject\",\n\"Annex II \",\n\"{'Action': 0.000339863880071789, 'ActionObject': 0.9996117949485779, 'AgendaStatus': 1.6001243663410492e-09, 'Body': 7.312607067433419e-06, 'Clarification': 1.427323041980344e-07, 'Conclusion': 4.4529933518333564e-08, 'Election': 3.86468309443444e-06, 'General': 1.5240628954416024e-06, 'Introduction': 2.0093189334602357e-09, 'MeetingDateTime': 4.612784039181861e-07, 'MeetingLocation': 1.2160439766262243e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 1.2061251553063812e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 3.64021190080166e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 6.710703814860608e-07, 'OralStatement': 8.390679795411415e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 4.53924231536007e-09, 'RVRequested': 2.482149511706666e-06, 'RVTaken': 4.2299021174585505e-07, 'Session': 2.7312931706546806e-05, 'Sponsorship': 3.5550813208828913e-06, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 4.083910098984234e-09, 'Vote': 4.267397102353243e-09, 'VotingIntention': 4.5688774985563896e-10}\",\n[]],\n [{\n            'v': 878,\n            'f': \"878\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.7-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 95,\n            'f': \"95\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999998807907104,\n            'f': \"0.9999998807907104\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Address by Ms. Jeanine \\u00c1\\u00f1ez Ch\\u00e1vez, Constitutional President of the Plurinational State of Bolivia [Original: Spanish] Thank you very much. It is a pleasure and an honour to share the Assembly Hall with all of you. At no other time has Latin America seen more clearly that it must choose between the two roads that lie before it. The two roads do not lead \\u2014 as many intellectuals in the region have asserted \\u2014 either towards the left or the right; statism or neo-liberalism; or socialism or capitalism. The two roads, one of which we must choose, are simpler. One is the road of freedom and the other is the road of oppression. In other words, we are once again faced with the dilemma that arises between the choices of democracy or dictatorship. In short, we are faced with the dilemma of modernity. Did we create the State to oppress or to guarantee freedom? Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to choose. Let us admit that, in general, Latin America has not overcome the threat of authoritarianism. And let us concede that very important people in Latin American politics remain in the thrall of authoritarian temptation. And, consequently, let us accept that many of our societies are at risk of surrendering to new forms of authoritarianism and oppression. And what are these new forms of authoritarianism that threaten several of our nations? They are simply the pursuits of caudillismo and authoritarian populism. They encourage the appropriation and, if necessary, kidnapping of public life by a caudillo and his caste. It is not matter of parties, the armed forces, unions or ideologies. In sum, it has nothing to do with any organization or institution conceiving of the common good. It is about individual pursuits of power. Those pursuits aspire to see the Caudillo and his caste gain complete control of the political sphere, culture, the economy and ultimately the freedom of the people. They are founded on the idea of privilege. And, for that reason, run contrary to the idea of rights. It is the system of the few. It is the system of castes. It is the system of the political elites. It is the system of the political clan. In short, Latin America has before it the road offered up by caudillismo and authoritarian populism. But it also has another path, which is different and opposed to caudillismo and authoritarian populism, respects the people and is based on democracy. In effect, after having lived through the populist era, Latin America has the option of building political coexistence, based on the republican tradition \\u2014 which is the tradition of freedom. That is the road we are building in Bolivia. It is the road leading towards returning power to the people. It is the road leading towards validating the rule of law. It is the road leading towards overcoming more than a decade of populist and authoritarian caudillismo. It is the road leading towards restoring the freedom of the citizens. And it is precisely in order to build that road to freedom that we are supporting fair and transparent elections on 18 October. And we are supporting them despite the fact that the proponents of caudillisto populism attempted to stop and sabotage them with brutal and violent actions a few weeks ago. Those actions included blocking highways so that oxygen intended for patients who had fallen ill to COVID-19 would not get by. It was an extraordinarily inhuman and cruel way of sowing chaos and terror. Such actions led to death and damage, which under the eyes of the law can clearly be seen as crimes against humanity. The Bolivian people, however, courageously and determinedly stopped the organized and systematic attempt to overthrow democracy and reinstall the dictatorship in Bolivia. We are a people who have decided to turn the page and leave behind the populist dictatorship. We are a people who no longer want to see Governments building palaces or museums dedicated to the caudillo. We are a people who want democracy, health care, employment, education and opportunities. And that is why the decision of the current Government to invest 10 per cent of the national budget in health care has been a very important step for Bolivia. And that is also why the efforts we have made in health care have been very important in achieving in three months what had not been achieved for decades in our country. They involved thousands of health-care jobs and other initiatives to equip hospitals and treat free of charge thousands of citizens who contracted the coronavirus disease. Similarly, in keeping with the purpose of establishing the Republic \\u2014 the Government of the people, the Government under the law for all and the Government devoted to political freedom \\u2014 we have established in Bolivia a support system for the people, which is unprecedented in our history. The pandemic reminded us of the enormous importance of helping one another. It reminded us of our Christian value to care for one another. And it reminded us of the ethics of mutual help as a path leading towards healthy coexistence among people who consider themselves to be brothers and sisters, free and equal. The support and assistance system that we have established is based on the providing cash vouchers to the population \\u2014 directly to all Bolivian families, with special emphasis on the people and families who are most in need. Well then, in view of the two roads of freedom and oppression, which I took the liberty of expounding upon, it is a pleasure to say in the Assembly that Bolivia has chosen the road of freedom. But I would be remiss if I did not conclude my statement without condemning before the world the systematic and abusive assault that the Kirchnerist Government is carrying out from Argentina against the institutions and republican values in Bolivia. We have nothing against the noble Argentine people. Moreover, it is a nation that we esteem and love like a brother. We have nothing against Peronism, which we value as a political tradition \\u2014 the national popular tradition \\u2014 and has been the driving force behind enormous achievements in the social modernization of Argentina. It is a tradition that we are familiar with in Bolivia where the 1952 Revolution, which exemplified the national popular tradition, set the stage for extraordinary progress with regard to equality and social justice. Nor do we harbour any bitterness towards other Governments, such as the Government of Havana, with which we do not agree ideologically. But we maintain the due respect and courtesy that characterize the relations between two sovereign States and between two brotherly peoples, who share a common history. But the case of the Argentine Government is different. It involves behaviour that I described earlier when I spoke of the populist castes, which do not hesitate to use frankly abusive methods to carry out their plans, obtain power and take stands that run contrary to promoting freedom. What is the Argentine Government\\u2019s authority to make interference the key to its foreign policy towards Bolivia? And what is its authority to protect a violent conspiracy by Evo Morales against Bolivian democracy from Argentine soil? And even worse, what is the authority of the Argentine Government to offer impunity to Evo Morales in cases as serious as the national and international investigations that are under way against this former dictator, for human rights violations, for sexual violations against girls or underage women, or for complicity in political murder? Kirchnerist populism knows that the Bolivian nation is not the private property of any caste. We are a sovereign and respectable people. Bolivia is respected. Bolivian democracy is respected. The Bolivian people respect themselves. Nor can I fail to mention the maritime issue in this speech. I call on the international community in these new times to resolve through negotiation and fraternal understanding the critical and pending problems between States, such as the Bolivia\\u2019s lack of sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. Ladies and Gentlemen: Bolivia has chosen freedom. She has chosen the republic. And no matter who your enemies are, the important thing is that democracy, freedom, institutions and republican values  have come to stay in Bolivia. We invite the world to look at our electoral process, which, unlike that promoted by Evo Morales last year, will be clean and free of fraud. We invite the world to look at our system of aid, bonds and solidarity, which has launched in Bolivia a historic stage of assistance to those who need it most. We invite the world to visit us, because we are a people that, despite so many political, social, economic and health difficulties, now looks forward with courage, freedom and joy. Thank you very much. God bless you. \",\n\"{'Action': 2.031575796479501e-09, 'ActionObject': 4.400065034548817e-10, 'AgendaStatus': 8.333092438306267e-09, 'Body': 1.1064303986896284e-11, 'Clarification': 6.643948058382421e-09, 'Conclusion': 5.879364772809481e-10, 'Election': 6.405089791883256e-09, 'General': 0.9999998807907104, 'Introduction': 1.6426463389507262e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 6.802863827815031e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 2.4806079412798e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 2.3979523922079693e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 2.602830173614734e-09, 'MeetingStatus': 3.1026323732419314e-09, 'OralStatement': 4.858830005005643e-10, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.402288228926409e-09, 'RVRequested': 3.218817226646742e-11, 'RVTaken': 4.9605885371617475e-11, 'Session': 3.473992760127942e-10, 'Sponsorship': 1.0071326411731363e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 6.982184275194925e-10, 'Vote': 6.601517554827296e-09, 'VotingIntention': 1.2600449572630623e-08}\",\n[[\"Jeanine \\u00c1\\u00f1ez Ch\\u00e1vez\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the Plurinational State of Bolivia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"One\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"more than a decade\", \"DATE\"], [\"18 October\", \"DATE\"], [\"a few weeks ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"three months\", \"DATE\"], [\"decades\", \"DATE\"], [\"thousands\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"thousands\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Argentina\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Argentina\", \"UNPE\"], [\"two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"between two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Evo Morales\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Evo Morales\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Evo Morales\", \"PERSON\"], [\"last year\", \"DATE\"], [\"God\", \"PERSON\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 879,\n            'f': \"879\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.7-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 96,\n            'f': \"96\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.8286123275756836,\n            'f': \"0.8286123275756836\",\n        },\n\"OralStatement\",\n\"Annex III [Original: Ukrainian; English translation provided by the delegation] \",\n\"{'Action': 0.0008621995220892131, 'ActionObject': 0.01283042598515749, 'AgendaStatus': 0.0017844346584752202, 'Body': 0.0011584615567699075, 'Clarification': 0.0027327784337103367, 'Conclusion': 0.11203189194202423, 'Election': 2.3134102775657084e-06, 'General': 3.608786528275232e-06, 'Introduction': 1.2272961384951486e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.487654481024947e-05, 'MeetingLocation': 9.364626748720184e-05, 'MeetingNumber': 5.481322659761645e-05, 'MeetingSegment': 5.0269234634470195e-05, 'MeetingStatus': 0.000542413501534611, 'OralStatement': 0.8286123275756836, 'PresidingOfficer': 8.003498805919662e-05, 'RVRequested': 0.0009657815680839121, 'RVTaken': 0.02520965039730072, 'Session': 0.0012774361530318856, 'Sponsorship': 0.007655397988855839, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.621820410946384e-05, 'Vote': 3.920033861959382e-07, 'VotingIntention': 0.0040194871835410595}\",\n[]],\n [{\n            'v': 880,\n            'f': \"880\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.7-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 97,\n            'f': \"97\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999998807907104,\n            'f': \"0.9999998807907104\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Address by Mr. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine Distinguished Mr. President, Your Excellences! Ladies and Gentlemen! On behalf of Ukraine I have the honour to congratulate you, Mr. Bozkir, on your election as President of the 75th UN General Assembly session. You are steering the Assembly in hard times when even traditional international instruments and formats may not work. That is why I want to assure that Ukraine has been and will continue to be a reliable partner for you and the United Nations, even despite the fact that we are separated by thousands of kilometers. A year ago, in New York we discussed threats to the future of the world, we devised plans, we made forecasts. But could anyone has imagined back then that the year 2020 would stage such a crush test for the planet? The countries lock down their borders, the Summer Olympic Games postponed, and the session of the UN General Assembly is held online. A year ago, we would say that this is a script for the apocalyptical blockbuster, not the realities of 2020. In such uneasy for the world times it makes sense to recall the feelings of the leaders of the United Nations founding states 75 years ago. The humanity just survived the most horrendous war. The world resembled a soldier who was strolling across a blood-drenched field a minute after the explosions stopped. Emaciated, hollowed, at a loss but alive. The Second World War became a \\u201cglobal earthquake\\u201d that claimed tens of millions of lives. Yet humanity managed to recover. And on 24 October 1945, at the conference in San Francisco, the UN founding nations, with Ukraine among them, put aside all contradictions and got united to build a better world together. Undoubtedly, during these 75 years numerous achievements were made in terms of economic development, poverty eradication, minimization of wars and cataclysms that could have happened was it not for the United Nations. The humanity conquered the Space, and even can hold UN sessions remotely thanks to modern technologies. Speaking the language of these technologies, the UN has become a software that saved the world from critical errors. At the same time, we have to acknowledge that the system is getting glitched more and more. It is being attacked by new \\u201cbugs\\u201d or \\u201cviruses\\u201d. And their containment is not always efficient. I am saying it as the Head of a state in which in the 21st century the Russian Federation annexed the Crimean Peninsula. Head of the state, which is containing Russia\\u2019s military aggression in Donbas for the seventh year in a row. What feelings would the founders of the United Nations have, had they known that 75 years later, in the center of Europe, there would be a war? That in Crimea human rights would be flagrantly violated, that persecutions of Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars would be taking place. That militarization of the peninsula and water areas around it would be building up, which would undermine security balance of the Black Sea region. Would they change something in the UN Charter and mechanisms of the United Nations had they known that 75 years later, as a result of the war in Donbas, there would be 14,000 killed and almost 1.5 million people would lose their homes? Undoubtedly, over the last year we proved that Ukraine really strives for peace. We managed to unblock the dialogue, we resumed meetings of the Normandy format leaders, we made substantial progress in mutual release of the detained persons. And starting from 27 July, there is a comprehensive ceasefire in place, which, despite attempts to disrupt it, still gives hope for achieving sustainable ceasefire. And it is badly needed to keep moving towards genuine peace. The next steps on this way should become the withdrawal of unlawful military formations and armaments from the occupied territories, return of control over the state border, and, finally, restoring territorial integrity of Ukraine within the internationally recognized borders. We are grateful to our international partners for the help and support on this difficult way. We hope for further unity of the international community on this cause. I\\u2019m convinced that it is the United Nations that should play an important role in restoring sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, along with respect of the international law. We need to improve the existing mechanisms to this end. It is unacceptable when sovereignty of the independent state is violated by one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council. It ultimately proves that the mechanisms of the 1945 do not work today to the full extent. All this can bring about further depreciation of the Security Council. Ukraine will actively participate in its reform. This body should become more representative, balanced, transparent and efficient. It is in the United Nations\\u2019 vested interest to have an effective instrument if somebody is violating and abusing the veto right and the status of the permanent member. In addition, availing myself of this opportunity I want to invite our friends to participate in the establishment of the international Crimea platform for concerted actions to protect the rights of the Crimeans and de occupy the peninsula. I also call for support of the updated resolution \\u201cSituation with human rights in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine\\u201d that will be presented to the General Assembly by the end of this year. And what is the most important \\u2014 the cases of Crimea and Donbas should not become customary elements of the international landscape where only reports, conferences and protocol statements on the anniversaries of occupation will be taken as sufficient form of the international reaction. On the contrary \\u2014 until the wound in the center of Europe is bleeding, the pain will be felt all over the world. And the only recipe for the efficient treatment is the de-occupation of Crimea and Donbas. I understand that from 2014 on this message is heard at the UN every year. But this is exactly where the biggest problem lies. And it is not only about the Ukrainian case; it is about all global threats to the planet, reports on which are getting longer and longer with every passing year. And what is the most terrifying is that calamities have become a new normal. The world got accustomed to horrible news. They still shock but are quickly forgotten once a new information bomb explodes on the global agenda. At the last year\\u2019s Assembly session, I said: \\u201cThere is no more a notion of somebody else\\u2019s war. Our planet is not that big anymore\\u201d. It is proved by the MH17 case. It is proved by the environmental threats. By problems with access to food and drinking water. It is proved by information threats to the world. When disinformation and fake news can influence world markets,stock exchanges and even electoral processes. Ukraine, being one of the countries that from 2014 on actively counteracts the propaganda and information attacks, stands ready to initiate the establishment in Kyiv of the headquarters of the international office to counter disinformation and propaganda. The fact that our planet is not that big anymore was finally proved by the year 2020. Fires in Australia that shook the world. Or downing of a Boeing 737, when Ukrainian aircraft carrying the citizens of Ukraine, Canada, Iran, Afghanistan, United Kingdom and Sweden was struck down over the territory of Iran. And of course \\u2014 COVID-19 pandemic, which spread at a lightning speed. The mankind did not even manage to google \\u201cCovid\\u201d and \\u201cWuhan\\u201d when coronavirus was already knocking on the door of every house. Consider also this. Coronavirus spares no one. It does not care whether the country has nuclear weapons or what is the level of its GDP, whether the state is part of G7 or G20, whether Christianity, Islam, Judaism or other religions are professed in this country. All of it matters nothing for COVID. The COVID-19 showed that global world is not just the world without borders. It is also about global responsibility, when counteracting joint threats should involve not 7, not 20, but at least 193 countries. Today we are coming to understanding that the fight against COVID-19 will not take just one year. It is hardly the last pandemic that we will have to see through. That is why we have to emerge from the existing crisis stronger and well prepared. This is the test for all countries. A race for limited resources will only exacerbate the problems. What we need is sincerity in dialogue and active solidarity, because this is where the value of multilateralism lies. We have to overcome together the most serious economic crisis of the last years. The expected figures of GDP fall are sometimes double-digit. This is not just the statistics interesting for selected experts. This is the reduction of quality of life of billions of people, looming rise of a threat of hunger for millions. To unite efforts of all the countries is a must of our time. Ukraine cannot stand aside and is ready to make its own contribution in ensuring, in particular, the food security of the mankind. Mr. President, Every year the call for actions instead of talks is getting louder and louder in the General Assembly. It testifies to the crisis the United Nations, the security architecture, the health of humanity, our economies and the world as a whole find themselves in. The 75th anniversary of the UN foundation should become an impetus for transforming our Organization into a more dynamic and efficient body. I really want to start my speech in 2021 by saying that the 75th General Assembly session will come down in history as an example of returning to active multilateralism and efficient international solidarity. A session which did not only recall the Purposes and Principles of the UN Charter but started to permanently and unwaveringly follow them. A session which revived the truth that was fundamental when the UN was established: we don\\u2019t have a planet B. We live here and just once. And this is exactly the future we want, and this is exactly the UN we need. I sincerely wish you, Mr. President, to achieve this goal, along with all stakeholders.

It would have been an honour for me to personally deliver my maiden address at the rostrum of the General Assembly. The onset and continued prevalence of COVID-19 has prevented this. Thankfully we can make optimal use of modern technology. As President of the 75th session of the General Assembly you will undoubtedly face challenges in the conduct of international relations and conference diplomacy. Please allow me to pledge our full support in the successful discharge of your duties. We salute your predecessor, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, for his skillful leadership of the previous session and wish him well in his future endeavors. To Secretary-General Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres, we wish to pay tribute for his sterling efforts in guiding this organization. Mr. President, The COVID-19 pandemic is, apart from the human toll, turning food supply chains upside down, paralysing economies and eroding consumer purchasing power. And the United Nations World Economic Situation and Prospects (WESP) mid 2020 report, has confirmed what we as leaders and communities have experienced, that the pandemic has unleashed a health and economic crisis unprecedented in scope and magnitude. This compels us as an international community to embrace multilateralism as an effective way to win this battle and our best defense against future global threats, and to continue seeking effective means to support small and vulnerable nations. The theme of this years\\u2019 session of the General Debate is therefore opportune. Mr. President, The United Nations remains the premier international multilateral organization and should exert its eminent role and place in the development and furthering of the principles pertaining to international relations, international law, international peace and \\u2014 development. At the same time, the UN has been instrumental in bringing the world together to defend human rights, democracy and democratic institutions, uphold the rule of law, and good governance, sustain peace and security and advance the path towards realizing the 17 sustainable development goals. Despite considerable progress made in global discussions on a variety of matters \\u2014 from climate change, sustainable development, migration, refugees, terrorism, cyber-warfare to nuclear proliferation \\u2014 we have experienced that multilateralism has occasionally come under attack. Since the founding of the United Nations 75 years ago, the geopolitical field has changed drastically. The Security Council membership and its working methods need a structured evaluation. Can you imagine that we have been elaborating for more than two (2) decades about reform of this main Organ! It is therefore fitting to ask ourselves if this organ is still relevant in its current form. Does it answer to the questions of today\\u2019s challenges and aspirations? I hope, Mr. President, that we don\\u2019t have to ask ourselves this question again in 75 years! It is therefore of utmost importance that multilateralism adapts to these changing times. I call on the international community of nations to embark on a strategic assessment of the existing multilateral framework. Let us , based on the current realities, and challenges, dare to create a new multilateralism that fundamentally focuses on peace and prosperity of all nations and allows for the increased efficiency in the supporting institutional framework. A multilateralism, that acknowledges all nations, irrespective of their size and development level and place in the global order, as equal and with respect. A multilateralism where compliance by every state with international law and internationally accepted principles forms the bedrock of our interactions; A multilateralism, based on international cooperation to confront the many global challenges and seizing the common opportunities, that promotes a culture of inclusiveness and equality. Unilateral actions have always proven counterproductive and will never lead to achieve any defined objective. Nevertheless, dialogue and the active involvement of all countries, taking into account international principles, is what we should strive for. More importantly, mr. President, a multilateralism that necessitates us to recommit to the vision of the UN Charter. In this regard, we call for the lifting of the longstanding unilateral economic, financial and commercial embargo against the Republic of Cuba and its people. Multilateralism for climate change Mr. President, While the focus of the international community is currently on managing and containing the further spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, we should continue to dedicate our attention to other challenges of equal or even greater impact on the sustainable development of countries and the entire planet. Addressing the impact of climate change is one of these challenges. As a country with 239 miles of a low-lying coastline, Suriname is among the top 10 of most vulnerable countries with respect to the disastrous effects of sea-level rise as a result of global warming. Despite this position, Suriname has taken the lead as the country with the highest forest cover and low deforestation rate, to advocate for the mobilization of financial resources in support of our sustainable development, while making a significant contribution to mitigating global warming. It is estimated that our standing forests store 12 gigatons of forest carbon per year. Not a small contribution at all, I believe! However, these national commitments may only serve particular domestic concerns, but to maximize their impact strong international engagement is necessary with ambitious and attainable targets. Suriname will focus strongly on generating investment and business opportunities. It is mainly for this reason that my Administration will develop and act on the widest implementation of SDG Number 17, by the promotion and facilitation of clean and corruption free Public Private Partnerships (PPP). Reform of the international system Mr. President, In the past years we have realized reforms of the United Nations system, but much remains to be done. Participation of developing countries, especially the small economies, in the global financial and trading system is one of the long overdue reforms that has to take place. I believe that global strategic collaboration and complimentary financial \\u2014 economic approaches are required. This can be achieved through closer partnerships between the IMF, World Bank and the WTO. The way forward Mr. President, Developing countries and nations in the South should not be passive in their quest for development. Consequently, South-South cooperation, not to the exclusion of North-South relations, should be further explored and expanded in articulating and promoting the collective economic and business interests. This is in essence what our people elect us for. This is what the international community expects of its leaders, to be examples of inspiring leadership and vanguards of hope for our common humanity. It is the same hope that allows us to break down walls of mistrust, which may take the form of intolerance, fear, or violence. It is the same hope that leads us to strive for peace and prosperity as our predecessors did. It is particularly this hope that will give the upcoming generation of leaders the strength to elevate this global Assembly of World Leaders to a place where, collectively, the nations of the world should find ways to make a better life possible for all of the global community, for the next 75 years. I congratulate all of us with reaching this milestone anniversary. Let us all in unity, respect and solidarity strive to make the next 75 years even better and save for our future. I thank you. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.7931260032355567e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.2708232688396492e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 7.225649767406139e-08, 'Body': 2.102124169178765e-10, 'Clarification': 3.341920873367599e-08, 'Conclusion': 4.220908955687719e-09, 'Election': 5.3977313285713535e-08, 'General': 0.9999991655349731, 'Introduction': 4.245887623710587e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 4.070185966043027e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 1.1679782474516287e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 2.1803681082843696e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 8.839333531796001e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 1.295653095922944e-08, 'OralStatement': 9.785066978906798e-09, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.0195082111863485e-08, 'RVRequested': 4.169758427430281e-10, 'RVTaken': 6.425173171287213e-10, 'Session': 3.283236793549804e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.4344847532044014e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 4.8713753031393026e-09, 'Vote': 1.1925260778866686e-08, 'VotingIntention': 4.80651287659839e-08}\",\n[[\"Chandrikapersad Santokhi\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the Republic of Suriname\", \"UNPE\"], [\"75th\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Tijjani Muhammad-Bande\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres\", \"PERSON\"], [\"mid 2020\", \"DATE\"], [\"this years\", \"DATE\"], [\"17\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"75 years ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"more than two\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2) decades\", \"DATE\"], [\"Organ\", \"PERSON\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"75 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the Republic of Cuba\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Suriname\", \"UNPE\"], [\"10\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Suriname\", \"UNPE\"], [\"12\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Suriname\", \"UNPE\"], [\"17\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the past years\", \"DATE\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the next 75 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"the next 75 years\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 883,\n            'f': \"883\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.7-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 100,\n            'f': \"100\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.864383339881897,\n            'f': \"0.864383339881897\",\n        },\n\"Session\",\n\"Annex V \",\n\"{'Action': 0.0006804797449149191, 'ActionObject': 4.1280728835246805e-10, 'AgendaStatus': 2.2366242538596204e-11, 'Body': 1.0889450550166657e-06, 'Clarification': 2.7810154179519486e-10, 'Conclusion': 4.186867386124504e-08, 'Election': 0.04993203282356262, 'General': 5.4366748372558504e-05, 'Introduction': 1.0666615253285272e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 3.379212243359575e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 1.5103546502359677e-06, 'MeetingNumber': 1.249941590231174e-07, 'MeetingSegment': 2.1668663976015523e-05, 'MeetingStatus': 1.778712146460748e-07, 'OralStatement': 4.032830926842257e-14, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.3377471930198226e-07, 'RVRequested': 3.162644816256943e-06, 'RVTaken': 2.3596162463945802e-06, 'Session': 0.864383339881897, 'Sponsorship': 2.1489806556473923e-07, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.267761312069183e-09, 'Vote': 0.08491817861795425, 'VotingIntention': 6.241180905419697e-10}\",\n[]],\n [{\n            'v': 884,\n            'f': \"884\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.7-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 101,\n            'f': \"101\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 1.0,\n            'f': \"1.0\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Address by Ms. Simonetta Sommaruga, President of the Swiss Confederation [Original: French; English translation provided by the delegation] Mr President of the General Assembly, Mr Secretary-General, Distinguished Heads of State and government, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, There are moments that leave their mark for generations. The founding of the United Nations seventy-five years ago was one such moment. For this, we can be grateful to our parents. Are we nevertheless permitted to take a critical look at the UN today? \\u2014 Yes, we are... We even have to. In fact, seventy-five years on and there are still wars, there are more refugees and displaced people than ever before, there is a climate crisis currently without a solution, millions are going hungry and we haven\\u2019t achieved gender equality. We could criticise the UN for this \\u2014 but who are we really talking about, when we blame \\u201cthe UN\\u201d? We are in fact talking about ourselves, because the UN is its Member States. And it is often Member States that stand in the way of the UN\\u2019s work. They block decisions or refuse to implement them, undermine resolutions or flout their principles. This weakens the UN. And it weakens all of us, too. If we want a strong UN, then we \\u2014 Member States \\u2014 must strongly support the organisation and work together to pursue its objectives. Because the goals of the UN are our goals. Ladies and gentlemen, We live in an era marked by geopolitical tensions. Many States are also increasingly polarised in their internal affairs. More than ever, the UN is indispensable for the promotion of peace and security in the world. It embodies the causes of human rights, sustainable development and a world governed by the rule of law. We would do well to work together to achieve the goals of the UN because they benefit all of us and they make us stronger. My country is proud to contribute to the achievement of the UN\\u2019s goals, even if it is not always easy. It is difficult to translate the goals we have set ourselves \\u2013 on climate or gender equality for example \\u2013 into national policy. But that is why all of us politicians are elected: to offer our respective populations and humanity as a whole a decent life in freedom and security. My country also advocates for an international order regulated by the rule of law. We are committed to international humanitarian law and to the prevention of conflicts, and we provide good offices wherever they are desired. My country is prepared to take on more responsibilities, which is why for the first time, Switzerland is a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period Switzerland of course wholeheartedly supports the Secretary General\\u2019s appeal for a global ceasefire. But beyond such an appeal, is there anything else we can do? We must put even more effort into preventing conflicts. Here too, human rights must remain at the centre of our action. \\u201cInternational Geneva\\u201d also contributes to conflict prevention, for example by hosting the Human Rights Council and the Arms Trade Treaty Secretariat. By prosecuting the worst crimes, the International Criminal Court is contributing to uphold international humanitarian law. We reaffirm here our support for the International Criminal Court as an integral part of a rules-based international order. To facilitate debate on the best ways to adhere to these humanitarian norms, Switzerland was one of the first countries to publish a voluntary report on its national implementation. My country would welcome it if other countries followed. While it is right to try to prevent conflicts and to seek to mitigate their worst humanitarian consequences, it is also crucial to find lasting solutions to the conflicts that are ongoing. As the capital of peace, \\u201cInternational Geneva\\u201d contributes to this by providing a space for dialogue between the parties to a conflict. Switzerland\\u2019s peace policy draws on essential characteristics of my country\\u2019s political culture, such as power-sharing, openness to dialogue, tolerance and consideration of everyone\\u2019s interests. In the future, Switzerland intends to further step up its capacities and expertise in mediation and facilitation in order to support those who wish to end conflicts through dialogue. Ladies and gentlemen, While \\u201cInternational Geneva\\u201d contributes to peace and security in the world, it is also the seat of the World Health Organization, which has played such a crucial role since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The current health crisis has caused untold suffering in the world. The most vulnerable have been hit hardest: the child in the overcrowded displacement camp; the single mother who has lost her job; the young adult whose job prospects have been destroyed; or elderly people and the sick, who are particularly at risk. My country is coping with this pandemic as best it can. The World Health Organization plays a central part in fighting the pandemic. As host state of the WHO and other international health organisations, Switzerland is committed to ensuring that they can take effective action. For this to happen, the WHO must have sufficient resources and the support of all of us to carry out its reforms. Is it fair to demand so much from this organisation when 80% of its funding comes from voluntary contributions? Beyond the necessary fight against the current pandemic, we must think now about the world that will emerge from this crisis and that cannot entirely be yesterday\\u2019s. If every crisis is a suffering, it is also a moment of change that allows us to reinvent ourselves. So let\\u2019s reinvent ourselves, keeping in mind the goals we set for ourselves when the UN was created seventy-five years ago. Ladies and gentlemen, There are moments that leave their mark for generations. Such moments require decisive and courageous action. This is true today. From my country\\u2019s perspective, the most urgent tasks are to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement, and to step up our efforts for peace. It is up to us \\u2014 the political representatives of our countries \\u2014 to take the right decisions for the good of our fellow human beings and our planet. Let us assume this responsibility. Let us strengthen the UN\\u2019s capacity to act, and ensure that the decisions we make today will be a source of pride for generations of tomorrow. \",\n\"{'Action': 2.0222745700237965e-09, 'ActionObject': 3.235872014784036e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 1.1109025699340691e-08, 'Body': 1.3928026267040483e-11, 'Clarification': 6.695023646585696e-09, 'Conclusion': 3.2609820399542855e-10, 'Election': 7.117808564771622e-09, 'General': 1.0, 'Introduction': 2.885388816764589e-08, 'MeetingDateTime': 6.523324103113737e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 9.619943730498903e-10, 'MeetingNumber': 1.9163343134565025e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 3.934547798678523e-09, 'MeetingStatus': 2.1551280759979363e-09, 'OralStatement': 2.581289404446352e-09, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.1474804439970399e-09, 'RVRequested': 2.2833891027973507e-11, 'RVTaken': 4.0771240550352417e-11, 'Session': 2.2127748244837875e-10, 'Sponsorship': 1.2615058997411666e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.774855705795943e-10, 'Vote': 7.936927226559476e-10, 'VotingIntention': 4.972890543797348e-09}\",\n[[\"Simonetta Sommaruga\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the Swiss Confederation\", \"UNPE\"], [\"seventy-five years ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"millions\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"\\u201cthe UN\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"as a whole\", \"DR_MOD\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Switzerland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Switzerland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"\\u201cInternational Geneva\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"Switzerland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"\\u201cInternational Geneva\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"Switzerland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Switzerland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"\\u201cInternational Geneva\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"Switzerland\", \"UNPE\"], [\"yesterday\", \"DATE\"], [\"seventy-five years ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"2030\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"tomorrow\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 885,\n            'f': \"885\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.7-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 102,\n            'f': \"102\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.46431997418403625,\n            'f': \"0.46431997418403625\",\n        },\n\"Session\",\n\"Annex VI \",\n\"{'Action': 0.060674794018268585, 'ActionObject': 8.42445733724162e-05, 'AgendaStatus': 3.807869131122743e-09, 'Body': 0.4584898352622986, 'Clarification': 3.78611019868913e-07, 'Conclusion': 5.456722078633902e-07, 'Election': 0.009075528010725975, 'General': 2.2450821583752667e-12, 'Introduction': 8.935666095943873e-10, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.3903623766964301e-05, 'MeetingLocation': 3.6406192521099e-05, 'MeetingNumber': 0.00038856419268995523, 'MeetingSegment': 0.0023100238759070635, 'MeetingStatus': 0.0006630676216445863, 'OralStatement': 2.2718383263509168e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.3913564771428355e-06, 'RVRequested': 0.0004180738760624081, 'RVTaken': 0.0034471992403268814, 'Session': 0.46431997418403625, 'Sponsorship': 6.663837848464027e-05, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 8.57752468164108e-07, 'Vote': 8.280236215796322e-06, 'VotingIntention': 1.0215255308310134e-08}\",\n[]],\n [{\n            'v': 886,\n            'f': \"886\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.7-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 103,\n            'f': \"103\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999985694885254,\n            'f': \"0.9999985694885254\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Address by Mr. Aleksandar Vu\\u010di\\u0107, President of the Republic of Serbia Your Excellencies, The 75th UN anniversary and the 75th anniversary of the signing of the UN Charter is an important jubilee for the entire mankind. The Republic of Serbia strongly supports multilateralism and principles of the UN Charter. Sovereign equality of the countries, denial of use of force, non-interference in internal matters of other countries, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, peaceful resolution of conflicts and respect for differences are the principles whose validity has never been and must never be questioned. Big changes in the international scene brought by the 21st century only make the need for strict observation of the UN Charter and its well-known basic principles stronger. In this year of big jubilees, we mark at the same time the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. As a representative of a country and people who suffered a lot and had many victims in fighting Nazism and fascism, I want to convey that it is our common duty to keep the memory and learn from the most devastating conflict in modern history, as well as to jointly confront any attempt of relativization of ferocious crimes from the Second World War. Only with the help of lessons learned from the bitter past we can build a new, brighter vision of future. The Republic of Serbia is not among the big countries, neither by its territory nor by its population. That is why the United Nations General Assembly is a place of utmost significance, a place where the small ones as well have the right and opportunity to make their points, and defend them with arguments. That is why I am honored to address you today on behalf of the Republic of Serbia, a country that is firmly committed to the policy of peace and prosperity for the entire mankind. The debate we are having today in virtual format speaks for itself about the situation of today\\u2019s world and it is a confirmation that we must do anything to preserve and strengthen the United Nations and the General Assembly, as the most important forum where opinions of all member states on the most important topics of global importance can be heard. The topic of this year\\u2019s debate reminds us of the importance of multilateralism as the founding principal of the United Nations. We firmly believe that only by joint actions, mutual harmonization and respect, answers can be found in facing global challenges such as the ongoing Pandemic of the Communicable Disease COVID-19. The pandemic additionally emphasized the need for close and intensive international cooperation, whereby UN and its specialized agencies and organizations, like the World Health Organization, have the irreplaceable role in organized response to newly occurred challenges that are not only of a health nature, but they also have socio-economic, political and security dimension. COVID-19 pandemic strongly confirms the need and necessity of existence and strengthening of the role of the United Nations. The relevance of this forum must never be questioned. We firmly believe that only by mutual cooperation, harmonization of positions and mutual respect, a global response in facing this modern plague can be found. The United Nations we need, both today and in the future, must be adapted to newly occurred circumstances and ready for joint response to the modern age challenges. In that regard, the existing situation is the opportunity we must take for promoting system of international coordination and support. Precisely in that regard, the United Nations must have a key role and that is why we need to work continuously on adapting, strengthening and efficiency of the United Nations system, because it is the best way towards full achievement of the idea of multilateralism. Newly occurred reality in the world is another proof that modern challenges know no borders of the countries. Serbia is also facing problems in fighting this disease that caused tectonic changes worldwide and we received assistance of the friendly countries when we needed it the most, and I take this opportunity to thank them once again. I have to say many thanks to our European partners, to our Chinese friends, and to our Russian friends as well. Likewise, we showed solidarity and provided assistance to other countries and we will keep helping those who need it most in these difficult times. I avail myself of this opportunity to extend big gratitude for help and support provided by the United Nations and the World Health Organization to the Government of the Republic of Serbia in fighting pandemic. On the other hand, and beside already allocated financial support for strengthening response of healthcare systems to COVID-19, we will keep supporting the World Health Organization, as well as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI) as a leading stakeholder in the field of immunization. Even though the pandemic has shaken the strongest world economies, I have to say that Serbia managed to keep stable budget, as well as the entire fiscal and monetary system which is fully prepared to withhold assistance measures for economy, which is open for potential investment plans. We invested huge efforts in order to help survival of our economy, firstly thanks to disciplined and responsible management of public finance. Despite of the crisis effects, Serbia has excellent results in economy in the first two quarters of this year and we have strong reasons to believe that by the end of the year we will remain among the most stable economies in Europe. We are not a rich country, and I will say also that we are not a poor country, but we hope that by the end of the year we\\u2019ll have the biggest growth rate in entire Europe. So far, in the first six months, we became the first country \\u2014 at least the country with the biggest growth rate, and I hope that we will be able to continue in the same manner. Dear Friends, Full membership to the European Union is a foreign policy priority of the Republic of Serbia. However, our European path does not exclude commitment to development of cooperation and deepening relations with countries from all regions. We cherish partnership relations with the Western countries, including more intensive cooperation with the USA, but at the same time we are proud of exceptional relations with the Russian Federation and the People\\u2019s Republic of China. And, as you can see, we don\\u2019t hide that, we are very proud of our friendships. Cooperation with friendly African, Asia-Pacific and Latin American countries is also in the focus of our foreign policy activities. Additionally, improvement of regional cooperation is the basic starting point of our foreign policy and we believe that in relations with our neighbors we have acted as a responsible and reliable partner. We are committed to preservation of regional stability and intensifying cooperation in all areas, being that it contributes to reconciliation process, closer connectivity and development and it is to the benefit of the citizens of the entire region. We are aware of the seriousness and complexity of the problem in relations with some of our neighbors and we are committed to resolving them exclusively through dialogue, taking into consideration interests of all interested parties. In that context, Serbia strives to put special emphasis on the development of economic cooperation, believing that such approach may contribute to raising mutual trust, confidence, and thereby easier resolving of open issues. Guided precisely by the need to promote economic cooperation and create favorable investment climate in the Western Balkans region, in the fall of 2019, together with the Prime Minster of the North Macedonia and Albania, Zoran Zaev and Edi Rama, we inaugurated the initiative directed towards enabling freedom of movement of people, goods, services and capital, and much closer cooperation between our three countries. I want to underline that the initiative is open for other stakeholders from the Western Balkans and I hereby invite them to join, being that its essence is to be fully inclusive for everybody in our region. We believe that European perspective of the region was and remains important incentive for necessary reform processes and promotion of cooperation. We believe that without full integration of the Western Balkans to the EU, common economic and political space in the European continent will not be complete and we are convinced that enlargement policy is not only in the interest of the citizens of the Western Balkans, but also in the interest of the European Union. I am pleased that even in this difficult period caused by the COVID-19 pandemic a very high level of mutual solidarity in the region was demonstrated, which is to a great extent precisely the result of constructive and proactive relationship that Serbia has been building in previous years with its neighbors. We have cooperated intensively with regional countries related to both repatriation of citizens and related to issues of humanitarian and medical assistance, but also regular supply of goods. Decision on establishing \\u201cGreen Corridors\\u201d in our region was a useful one, which enabled smooth transport of assistance, without delays at border and administrative crossing points. Your Excellencies, You are familiar with our problem regarding preservation of the territorial integrity of Serbia, i.e. efforts to resolve \\u2014 despite all the obstacles, the issue of our Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija. Precisely the politics of Serbia for preservation of peace and stability, cooperation and economic progress I\\u2019ve mentioned earlier, is a sufficient incentive for approaching resolving this long lasting problem, in the best interest of the both Serbs and Albanians. On this path, we were and we will face numerous pressures because Serbia is at the crossroads where different political interests collide. We believe that it will be possible to reach a solution after the long and difficult dialogue, but rest assured that Serbia will never agree to humiliations. Accepting anything that is not compromise is not for us. And, by compromise, both sides must be equally either satisfied or dissatisfied. Recent renewal of the Belgrade-Pri\\u0161tina dialogue under the EU auspices, after almost two years of deadlock, is by all means the first step on that path. Additionally, big step forward in finding mutually acceptable solution for the issue of Kosovo and Metohija is a recent signing of the agreement on economic normalization in Washington, D.C., which involves a set of economic and infrastructure projects, which should enable better life for all citizens in that part of our country and of our region. I take this opportunity to underline and praise very constructive and important role that the administration of the President of the United States of America Donald Trump played in reaching this agreement, which is an important signal of their commitment in finding lasting and sustainable solution for this important issue. Dialogue between Belgrade and Provisional Institutions of Self-Government in Pri\\u0161tina, which has continued in Brussels with the EU intermediation, is the real path for reaching sustainable agreement between two sides, but the starting point can by no means be humiliating and unacceptable so-called independence of Kosovo. Despite of everything, we believe that the agreement between Serbs and Albanians is a key to regional stability. The Republic of Serbia remains committed to finding compromise solution for the issue of Kosovo and to building common future with the politics of peace and cooperation. Ladies and Gentlemen, Your Excellencies, The Republic of Serbia is not committed only to peace and security as well as to social and economic prosperity in the national and regional dimension, but it is also aware of the importance of active engagement in these areas globally. We attach big importance to the UN efforts in promoting and preserving peace and security worldwide and we actively participate in the collective security system. By continuing the tradition of Yugoslavia\\u2019s participation in UN peacekeeping missions, started in 1956, representatives of Serbia are actively engaged in UN and EU peacekeeping missions. It is with great pride that we underline that we are the leading country in the Western Balkans region, and the 9th biggest contributor on the list of leading European armed and police forces in UN missions. Additionally, Serbia will continue contributing fight against terrorism through full implementation of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and relevant Resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. Adoption of the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 as well as Paris Climate Change Agreement are key steps in facing some of the biggest challenges today \\u2014 global economic instability, growing social inequality and climate change effects. Dear Friends, The UN Charter should be a \\u201cConstitution\\u201d of the modern international community, collection of basic principles regulating international relations and processes in international community one must not stand back from. Unfortunately, at the very end of the 20th century, in my country we were witnesses and victims of unilateral measures and activities that undermine and question not only the efficiency of multilateralism and international cooperation mechanisms, but the international law itself. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, at that time, was bombed without the consent of the United Nations Security Council, whereby the UN Charter was most severely violated. After that, with a unilateral action by which the Provisional Institutions of the Self-Government in Pri\\u0161tina declared independence of the so-called Kosovo, UN SC Resolution 1244 (1999) was violated and stability of the Republic of Serbia, but also of the entire region, was seriously endangered. Let me remind you that the Republic of Serbia is fully committed to finding compromise solution for the issue of Kosovo and Metohija. Our politics is a responsible one; we do everything to protect the interests of our people, but also regional peace and stability. By defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity and by observing the UN SC Resolution 1244 (1999), the Republic of Serbia at the same time defends the international law, the UN Charter as well as the supremacy of the Security Council. We believe that it is essential to further strengthen in the upcoming period efforts for preservation of principles this Organization was founded on 75 years ago. We are convinced that the role of the United Nations in these processes was and remains irreplaceable. Rest assured that the Republic of Serbia will continue to act as a serious and reliable partner in achieving common goals, strengthening cooperation within the United Nations and building better future for all of us. Like I have already said, the Republic of Serbia is not within the group of big Countries, neither by its territory nor by its population. But, judging by its culture and contribution to science, our Country is among the most developed nations. UNESCO which with special piety emphasizes our medieval art and I dare say the most significant man of the 20th and 21st century, our scientist Nikola Tesla, proves our contribution to civilization and common good. The time frame between the White Angel fresco, the first painting that went to Orbit, and Tesla, covers the period from renaissance to our contemporaries. In its striving towards lasting peace and common wellbeing, Serbia obliged itself to military neutrality. We rightly believe that it is one of the strongest messages of peace that went from the Balkans to the world. The great American artist Isidora Duncan said after the Great War: \\u201cViolence by the big and powerful can often be turned against them. The best example that the great should not brutalize the small is the example of the small Serbian nation, which put an end to an empire that had lasted almost a thousand years.\\u201d Serbia despises any kind of violence. Serbia wants peace and prosperity, for itself and for the entire mankind. Serbia wants peace for its region. Thank you for your attention and stay safe. \",\n\"{'Action': 2.2228329399354152e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.512568381656365e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 1.0479818257635998e-07, 'Body': 4.1714423582028815e-10,

I take this opportunity to commend the international community, including the United Nations for defending the democratic rights of our citizens. My government is committed to greater political inclusion and to enacting institutional reforms to ensure that democracy, the rule of law and constitutional rights are respected. My Government recognizes the dignity and worth of the human person and is determined to secure for the country\\u2019s citizens a higher standard of living. I join in congratulating the United Nations on its 75th anniversary. I hope that we can soon meet in more normal circumstances to formally celebrate this momentous milestone. The United Nations was birthed 75 years ago amidst the scars of war and the promise of reconstruction. The international community conceived the United Nations and entrusted its hope in this body to usher in an era of peace and prosperity. The Charter of the United Nations commits to ending the scourge of war, fostering respect for human rights, promoting the dignity of the human person, securing equality for men women and nations, defending the principles of international law and advancing human freedoms and social progress. Every nation, no matter how large or small, has but a single vote within this Assembly. The General Assembly remains an invaluable fora where small states can make their voices heard and unite for their mutual benefit. Developing states in particular owe a great debt to this Organization. Its agencies and affiliated networks \\u2014 including the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children\\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \\u2014 have been instrumental in alleviating poverty, hunger and famine; saving and caring for lives; ensuring respect for human rights; promoting greater equality for women; safeguarding children; promoting the environment and providing technical assistance to developing states. Mr. President, I ask you all to cast your minds back to 2015, and the three pivotal UN conferences that took place during that year. In June, the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Addis Ababa, addressed the main challenge facing developing nations \\u2014 accessing development financing. In September, the Assembly hosted the Sustainable Development Summit and adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals which UN members agreed to realize by the year 2030. Most importantly, the Climate Change Summit in Paris culminated in the historic Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement on climate change represents the single greatest commitment made by countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These three events exemplified the true character of this organization \\u2014 the nations of the world uniting to boldly tackle these threat and to promote sustainable development. The United Nations, armed with the lofty but ambitious vision of global security and prosperity, remains as relevant and necessary today as it was in 1945. The world has changed remarkably in ensuing 75 years but the United Nations has also adapted to and been an agent of change. Among the changes which the United Nations has witnessed was the proliferation of newly-independent states, following the end of the Second World War. Many of these newly-independent states are developing countries which account for more than half of the world\\u2019s states and population. The United Nations make-up, inclusive of the Security Council, must reflect this reality. The Security Council, in particular, should be reformed to increase the number of developing countries that are permanent members. Mr. President, Developing countries continue to face constraints associated by limited access to development financing. Improved access to such financing is vital for the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals. The United Nations must continue to champion the need for great access to development financing for developing states. The UN has a special duty to ensure that members\\u2019 obligations under international agreements are fulfilled and that setbacks in meeting commitments are reversed. Guyana applause the ongoing work on reform of the United Nations development system (UNDS). We believe, however, that there should be greater focus on reforms that are tailored to allow the UN to respond adequately to existing and emerging gaps in development and to find solutions to existing threats. Mr. President, Multilateralism is the key to unlocking solutions to humanity\\u2019s problems. The ongoing public health and climate crises have demonstrated that it is in the common interest of humanity that we fully embrace the ideals of multilateralism. As a testimony to Guyana\\u2019s commitment to multilateralism, in January of this year we assumed the Chairmanship of the Group of 77 and China. Our statement to the world is that a state\\u2019s capacity for leadership is not constrained by its size. A product of our multilateral efforts is the United Nations development agenda. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development remains a viable plan of action to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path. In this critical Decade of Action and Delivery for Sustainable Development, we must be fully focused on eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions. No one must be left behind. At this time, an earnest and thorough assessment of the development agenda is warranted, with a view to recommitting ourselves to its aims. It is therefore regrettable that we missed the opportunity to adopt a robust outcome document at the conclusion of the 2020 High-Level segment of the Economic and Social Council and the High-Level Political Forum on sustainable development. Global partnerships for development had never been more urgent in order to mobilize the means to implement the \\u2018Agenda\\u2019. My government believes that both the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council should play a more proactive role in catalyzing partnerships and should serve as platforms for ensuring coherence in the joint economic, environmental, and socio-political initiatives being undertaken. Now more than ever, we need a resurgence of political will and commitment to protect the multilateral architecture and institutions, including the International Court of Justice. Guyana reposes confidence in this institution. We are committed to the rule of international law, inclusive of the peaceful resolution of disputes. In March 2018, Guyana filed its application in the International Court of Justice seeking an affirmation of the validity of the 1899 Arbitral Award and the international boundary that it established. We are happy to report that on the 30th of June, 2020 the International Court of Justice held its first virtual hearing on the controversy involving Guyana and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Regrettably, Venezuela has refused to participate in the hearing. Guyana now awaits the determination of the International Court of Justice on whether the Court has jurisdiction to proceed to hearing the merits of the case. Mr. President, As we consider the state of our world today, we must acknowledge the challenges facing us and their implications for the progress and prosperity of our peoples. Foremost on the list is the COVID-19 pandemic and its multidimensional impacts. The pandemic has launched an attack on the health and well-being of our people while the economy has become a causality of this assault. The pandemic is reversing our gains on health, poverty and education. More than ever, the resolve of the United Nations is being tested and it is evident that no single country can overcome the debilitating effects alone. This reality must inform the trajectory of the United Nations so that it can support the efforts of developing countries to rebuild and to become more resilient. A strong multilateral system is required for collective action to stem this pandemic. I acknowledge the support of UN agencies in my country\\u2019s response to the COVID-19 crisis. We trust and support the efforts of the UN system to ensure fair, transparent and timely global access to preventive tools, equipment and materials for testing. In this regard, we recognize the important role of the World Health Organization in coordinating the response of the UN system and in global public health preparedness and response. We look forward to increased international cooperation to contain, mitigate and defeat the pandemic. Mr. President, Competing and compounded by the pandemic is climate change. Every year is another record breaking year for extreme weather conditions and climate events. As a low-lying coastal State, Guyana, is acutely aware of the high toll of these extreme weather conditions. But equally costly is climate resilience. Developing countries are thus set between a rock and a hard place. The only way to ease this burden is through concerted and balanced climate action, especially via mitigation, climate financing, technical cooperation and capacity building. We also urge all States to set ambitious targets in their Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement and to work earnestly towards them. Guyana\\u2019s Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS) reflects our national development agenda. The strategy will ensure that we fulfill our Nationally Determined Contributions and place our country along a path of sustainable and climate-resilient development. Mr. President, Progress on the Sustainable Development Agenda will be impeded by conflicts. We therefore must continue to devote our collective efforts towards the achievement of peace in every region of the globe. Mr. President, The future we want and the United Nations that we need are in our hands. It is ours to fashion. History must not find us victims of inaction or succumbing to failure. Multilateralism is the pathway to achieving our ends. We must collectively work to preserve this instrument and to strengthen the United Nations as we build a better world for our generation and those to follow. I thank you. And God bless all the people of this planet, thank you. \",\n\"{'Action': 2.7697316440367103e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.9903335868320937e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 2.1203899791544245e-07, 'Body': 5.913518563716025e-10, 'Clarification': 7.155009740245077e-08, 'Conclusion': 1.367551316633353e-08, 'Election': 5.326032948005377e-08, 'General': 0.999997615814209, 'Introduction': 1.3705662240681704e-06, 'MeetingDateTime': 5.037979367017442e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 2.5435449302335655e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 5.266179492480205e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 3.095694864896359e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 2.934366527540533e-08, 'OralStatement': 2.8895732029354804e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.8942729102254816e-08, 'RVRequested': 1.0140313033701887e-09, 'RVTaken': 1.5803524044954997e-09, 'Session': 4.577317191944985e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.9047790011939014e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.4787292279550002e-08, 'Vote': 9.716369042678252e-09, 'VotingIntention': 1.489319174652337e-07}\",\n[[\"Mohamed Irfaan Ali\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the Co-operative Republic of Guyana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Guyana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"75th\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"the next year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Guyana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Tijjani Muhammad-Bande\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Nigeria\", \"UNPE\"], [\"74th\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"2 August this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"75th\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"75 years ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"The Charter of the United Nations\", \"PERSON\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"2015\", \"DATE\"], [\"three\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"that year\", \"DATE\"], [\"June\", \"DATE\"], [\"September\", \"DATE\"], [\"17\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the year 2030\", \"DATE\"], [\"three\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"1945\", \"DATE\"], [\"75 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"the end of the\", \"DATE\"], [\"more than half\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Guyana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Multilateralism\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Guyana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"January of this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"China\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2030\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"2020\", \"DATE\"], [\"\\u2018Agenda\\u2019\", \"Entitled\"], [\"Guyana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"March 2018\", \"DATE\"], [\"Guyana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"1899\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the 30th of June, 2020\", \"DATE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Guyana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Guyana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Every year\", \"DATE\"], [\"Guyana\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Guyana\", \"UNPE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 889,\n            'f': \"889\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.7-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 106,\n            'f': \"106\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.995324969291687,\n            'f': \"0.995324969291687\",\n        },\n\"MeetingSegment\",\n\"Annex VIII \",\n\"{'Action': 0.00162963243201375, 'ActionObject': 0.00010444153303978965, 'AgendaStatus': 7.304783622430477e-08, 'Body': 0.0025185418780893087, 'Clarification': 9.907736853165261e-08, 'Conclusion': 3.929931580159973e-08, 'Election': 6.066546120564453e-05, 'General': 5.308811168447392e-10, 'Introduction': 4.530781527734007e-09, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.5041416051863052e-08, 'MeetingLocation': 6.317209795270173e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 8.748689879212179e-07, 'MeetingSegment': 0.995324969291687, 'MeetingStatus': 1.2814133754091017e-07, 'OralStatement': 2.2577374693355523e-05, 'PresidingOfficer': 9.080377338932522e-08, 'RVRequested': 5.205007710173959e-06, 'RVTaken': 2.3436488845618442e-05, 'Session': 0.00016009337559808046, 'Sponsorship': 7.742805610178038e-05, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 7.087939593475312e-05, 'Vote': 1.725808829178277e-09, 'VotingIntention': 6.965780130485655e-08}\",\n[]],\n [{\n            'v': 890,\n            'f': \"890\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.7-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 107,\n            'f': \"107\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 1.0,\n            'f': \"1.0\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Address by Mr. Mario Abdo Ben\\u00edtez, President of the Republic of Paraguay [Original: Spanish] President of the General Assembly, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, As the Assembly is a virtual event, I extend warm greetings to everyone at this difficult time amid the pandemic. We are united more than ever before in the spirit of solidarity. I welcome and congratulate Ambassador Volkan Bozkir on his election as President of the General Assembly and wish him success. I also welcome Secretary- General Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres and thank him for his work. Mr. President, The coronavirus changed everyone\\u2019s life, brought with it much pain and uncertainty, led to the loss of countless lives and put strong pressure on the health systems of all countries. I agree with German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it is the greatest challenge since the Second World War. The health crisis also led to an economic crisis that destroyed jobs and caused debt and challenges in making payments. No country was prepared for it. That is why I believe that the multilateral financial institutions should redesign their strategies to promote economic recovery that is more humane, supportive and substantial. Excellencies, Today\\u2019s world presents us with problems that cannot be addressed in isolation. That is why the deepening of multilateralism is an effective tool for responding to the needs we share, such as the quest for peace, the protection of human rights, the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, protection of the environment, the fight against climate change, and international trade based on principles and rules. We therefore underscore the importance of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as a road map that should guide us towards a more equitable world for future generations. Landlocked developing countries have special needs and particular challenges that must be addressed. In this regard, Paraguay stresses the importance of the effective implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action on this issue, in particular by transit countries. In the spirit of integration that seeks to boost trade and achieve mutual benefits for economies and societies, Paraguay is committed to the early signing of the agreement between MERCOSUR and the European Union, as well as with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Ladies and gentlemen, I again endorse Paraguay\\u2019s commitment to protecting life, family and human rights, as set out in our Constitution. Therefore, we strongly condemn terrorism and criminal groups that today use children and adolescents as human shields to protect themselves. They exploit and expose them to violence, indoctrinate them and train them in the use of weapons. Children, who should be in their homes, are used by criminals who resort to kidnapping, extortion and drug trafficking to support themselves. It leaves painful scars on our families. Paraguay is affected by it. This leads me to underscore the duty to protect the inhabitants of my country from these criminal groups that seek to justify their illicit conduct with narratives camouflaged by ideology and supported by propaganda designed to distort the truth. Illegality is bold when covered up; it is very skilled in acquiring the attributes of good will and altruism, but Paraguay refuses to be deceived. We will not rest until the full weight of the law is brought to bear on them. The doors of my country will remain open to international organizations offering to support us and verify our efforts. Paraguay acts with transparency and remains committed to the law. Mr. President, Paraguay supports the reform of the Security Council to make it more inclusive and responsive to threats to international peace and security. We will also continue to contribute troops to peacekeeping operations, as we have done for decades. Distinguished delegates, The Venezuelan diaspora is the second largest in the world. More than 5 million Venezuelans have been forced to emigrate to our countries. I again express my solidarity with the Venezuelan people as they continue to suffer. Paraguay will continue to support the international condemnation of human rights violations in Venezuela. Based on the principle of universality for which the Organization is known, we support Taiwan\\u2019s request to be included in the United Nations system. We also welcome the historic establishment of diplomatic relations between the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain and Israel, under the auspices of the United States of America. We hope that these new ties will contribute to peace and prosperity in the Middle East. Excellencies, Only by working together to achieve our common purpose and build a modern international architecture and by rising to the occasion can we achieve the results that our people need and expect from us. I leave you with the words of His Holiness Pope Francis: \\u201cWhen we emerge from this pandemic, we will no longer be able to do what we have been doing and how we have been doing it. No, everything will be different ... From the great trials of humanity, including the pandemic, we emerge either better or worse. We do not come out the same\\u201d. May our meeting, which demonstrates solidarity, be constant and help us to come out better. \",\n\"{'Action': 3.100035783631938e-09, 'ActionObject': 3.4354477040920983e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 5.6893236788368995e-09, 'Body': 1.8674161175735726e-11, 'Clarification': 1.1110826925175843e-08, 'Conclusion': 4.1089229241286773e-10, 'Election': 3.975160645097731e-09, 'General': 1.0, 'Introduction': 2.271247900864637e-08, 'MeetingDateTime': 8.186201716497976e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 1.335263122292929e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 1.534739418884712e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 2.8489064440861966e-09, 'MeetingStatus': 2.1213233392103348e-09, 'OralStatement': 5.28375876385212e-09, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.4562312466992466e-09, 'RVRequested': 1.4351085424191279e-11, 'RVTaken': 6.101628230448242e-11, 'Session': 2.4682791921470937e-10, 'Sponsorship': 3.9028996701162555e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 6.497755666856619e-10, 'Vote': 9.339293782772984e-10, 'VotingIntention': 1.114978243066389e-08}\",\n[[\"Mario Abdo Ben\\u00edtez\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the Republic of Paraguay\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Volkan Bozkir\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres\", \"PERSON\"], [\"President\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Angela Merkel\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Paraguay\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Paraguay\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the European Union\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Paraguay\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Paraguay\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Paraguay\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Paraguay\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Paraguay\", \"UNPE\"], [\"decades\", \"DATE\"], [\"second\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"More than 5 million\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Paraguay\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the United Arab Emirates\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Bahrain\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Israel\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the United States of America\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Francis\", \"PERSON\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 891,\n            'f': \"891\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.7-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 108,\n            'f': \"108\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.8661310076713562,\n            'f': \"0.8661310076713562\",\n        },\n\"Session\",\n\"Annex IX \",\n\"{'Action': 0.004009651485830545, 'ActionObject': 0.0004481601354200393, 'AgendaStatus': 2.6914341333394987e-07, 'Body': 0.0006427965709008276, 'Clarification': 5.824546178700984e-07, 'Conclusion': 2.795235104713356e-06, 'Election': 0.029242515563964844, 'General': 0.0005492806085385382, 'Introduction': 2.4657504127389984e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 1.3340148825591314e-06, 'MeetingLocation': 1.695678110991139e-05, 'MeetingNumber': 8.049226744333282e-05, 'MeetingSegment': 0.09844280034303665, 'MeetingStatus': 4.882009670836851e-05, 'OralStatement': 2.0268478806428902e-07, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.7063156292351778e-06, 'RVRequested': 0.00023004670219961554, 'RVTaken': 7.477587496396154e-05, 'Session': 0.8661310076713562, 'Sponsorship': 3.056534842471592e-05, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.6501405514522958e-08, 'Vote': 4.493985034059733e-05, 'VotingIntention': 1.0864590649362071e-07}\",\n[]],\n [{\n            'v': 892,\n            'f': \"892\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.7-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 109,\n            'f': \"109\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 1.0,\n            'f': \"1.0\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Address by Mr. Mohammad Ashraf Ghani, President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Bismillah Rahman-ur-Rahim Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, We, the peoples of the United Nations, this year observe our 75th anniversary. We do so at a time of unprecedented global turmoil. All of us here today share a common condition \\u2014 a condition that does not distinguish between developed or developing countries. This turmoil that defines our times is a global phenomenon. And while all of us bear a share of the burden of this turmoil, some countries bear a much larger share than others. Afghanistan is one such country. We find ourselves simultaneously at the centre of regional opportunity and also at the centre of the manifestation of global problems. Afghanistan is positioned right at the heart of Asia. Our water ties us together; our cultures and languages give us a common denominator. South Asia\\u2019s need for energy resources and Central Asia\\u2019s abundance of them makes Afghanistan a critical connector. Asia cannot integrate without us. We are right at the heart of untapped potential that could bring prosperity and peace to our region. But this means that we are also right in the middle of the turmoil that is affecting us all today. We are experiencing the worst of it. But Afghanistan could be a model for successfully overcoming the turmoil we all face. That task, like the turmoil, is one that belongs to all of us. We must first identify the drivers of this turmoil. There are five sources, all of which Afghanistan has been dealing with simultaneously. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed our vulnerabilities, to the point that we, as a global community, could no longer afford to ignore them. We Afghans were fortunate to have contained the first wave of the pandemic through close Government, business and societal cooperation, with minimal input from UN agencies, but the pandemic has exposed gaps in our systems that must be addressed. The COVID-19 pandemic has done for us what World War II did for generations before us \\u2014 both had such immense human costs and were phenomenon that had such a global impact that then, and now, we are forced to pay attention and take unprecedented action. In the face of vulnerabilities exacerbated by the pandemic, another driver of inequality and unemployment is upending our world \\u2014 the 4th industrial revolution. The digital age is upon us, challenging us to adapt the ways we consume, the ways we work, and the ways we govern. In Afghanistan, we are experimenting with how to adapt so that this digital revolution can be wielded as a source of economic opportunity for our overwhelmingly young population, as well as a way to strengthen our systems of governance and rule of law. We are looking far ahead with the knowledge that if we try to replicate 19th or 20th century models now, they will become irrelevant as soon as we stabilize them. The same can be said for global attempts to harness the drive of the 4th industrial revolution \\u2014 we have to think ahead of our time. This new kind of industrial revolution, combined with the pandemic, presented challenges in planning and executing this very gathering, and yet the UNGA leadership has managed to creatively transform this experience into one that is more efficient, effective, convenient and far less risky. I want to congratulate His Excellency Volkan Bozkir not only on assuming the Presidency of this 75th Session of the UNGA, but also for his success in overcoming the particular challenge of hosting a massive gathering of global leaders during the pandemic. Violence and warfare have also evolved, an evolution we Afghans have witnessed and suffered in real time. We are living, and dying, inside the 5th wave of global terrorism, in which global terrorist networks are closely linked with global criminal networks, making warfare totally unconventional and peace-building even more of a challenge. As a state and society, we have demonstrated the commitment, compassion and courage to take hard decisions to start direct peace talks with the Taliban. This won\\u2019t be enough. For sustainable in Afghanistan, we must get to the root of the terrorism problem blighting our region and address it as the global phenomenon, and threat, that it is. The untold sorrow of the Afghan people, particularly our women and children, during the last 40 years, serves as a reminder of the relevance of the UN Charter, and also of its unfulfilled promise, of \\u201cmaintaining international peace and security.\\u201d Climate change has effected another type of violence and suffering on our people. Afghanistan is the 17th worst affected country in the world. Just last month, hundreds of Afghans were killed or injured, and had their entire homes and livelihoods destroyed, when massive flood waters ripped through the province of Parwan and 13 other provinces. Two years before, the other extreme \\u2014 drought \\u2014 led us to nation-wide wheat shortages and upended the livelihoods of the majority of our population who rely on jobs in agriculture to put food on their tables. Drought and floods are seasonal occurrences for Afghanistan. We need regional solutions based on international models to address the problem of climate change. We have signed memoranda of understanding with the Fortescue Metals Group to change Afghanistan into a leading green industry, energy and intend to produce 20,000 megawatts from hydro and use it to produce zero emissions steel and other products from an estimated $1 trillion in mineral resources. We are also in discussion with other corporations to turn 70,000 megawatts of wind, and 220,000 megawatts of solar into renewable energy, thereby become a hub for renewable energy and green industry in the region. The fifth driver of turmoil is a culmination of the first four \\u2014 an unprecedented explosion of inequality that will continue to perpetuate this state of turmoil, until \\u2014 or unless \\u2014 we take action. In Afghanistan we are focusing on human capital and human security to create the equality of opportunities for our fellow citizen and societal stability for our people. I come back now to the first driver \\u2014 the COVID-19 pandemic \\u2014 because the scope and scale of its impact forced us to see the other four drivers, which were worsened and highlighted by the pandemic. The pandemic taught us an urgent lesson: We can no longer ignore these drivers. The cost of our inaction is uncertainty. We are asking ourselves at this General Assembly what kind of future do we want to live in? In truth, the extreme levels of uncertainty make the future very difficult to predict, but if I were to try and address that question my answer would be simple. We have to get back to basics. We have to go back to the foundational values of the United Nations and the documents that enshrine them \\u2014 the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \\u2014 and we have to fulfill these yet- unfulfilled promises. The future must hold, to quote the preamble of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \\u201crecognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family,\\u201d which is truly the \\u201cfoundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world\\u201d. These values have been embraced the world over. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is today universal discourse. Its values have been reflected in almost all state constitutions since the demise of the Soviet Union. But these values have not been actualized. These should not be lofty ideals and aspirations of the international community. They should be achievable goals. In Afghanistan, they are urgent and real problems we grapple with daily. What will it take to fulfill these promises of peace, prosperity, dignity, justice, and freedom? To shape our shared future in a direction that will fulfill these promises for all of us will take unprecedented acts of cooperative and coordinated actions at all levels of the global village\\u2019s community, economy and governance. We need frameworks for the future that present pragmatic solutions for collectively addressing and solving the five drivers of turmoil, particularly global terrorism and climate change. This will require the type of imagination and leadership that gave us the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Charter and the capabilities that overcame the global turmoil inflicted on the world by the Second World War. With these frameworks in place, we can get back to the foundational basics that the United Nations was created to address in the first place. The United Nations that we need is an organization with the authorities, capabilities, capitals, and commitments to fulfill the purposes and principles of this Charter. I would like to commend His Excellency Secretary-General Guterres for the progress made so far in his reform agenda for the UN. But we have much further to go, and we all have a shared responsibility to shoulder in efforts to progress the sustainable development goals and progress peace, prosperity and security across the globe. In Afghanistan, we are moving into the next five years with a clear plan for progressing the values of the UN, which are enshrined in our constitution, and working toward prosperity, security and peace in our own country. Our plan is based on building our markets for economic development, moving from an aid to a trade model, increasing our labor and capital productivity in key areas in which we have a competitive advantage. The objective is self-reliance, moving away from donor relationships to mutually beneficial partnerships. At the same time, we will invest in strengthening state governance structures to create an environment conducive to growth. This means continuing to combat systemic corruption, improving our public financial management systems, and strengthen provincial and district level governance. We are looking closely at the gaps and weaknesses exposed by the pandemic, and strengthening our systems for the long-term. Though we are facing multiple drivers of turmoil all at once in Afghanistan, above all, peace remains our most urgent and important priority. There is a passage from the preamble of the Charter of the United Nations that encapsulates our current goals for peace in Afghanistan. We want \\u201cto save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and... to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security\\u201d. The role of the United Nations in standing for our shared values throughout the peace process is absolutely critical, and we thank the United Nations for their support so far throughout this arduous process. We thank the UN for their call for a global ceasefire. The role of the UN and our international partners and allies will continue to be extremely important as our negotiating team sits across from the Taliban in Doha. At those talks, the Afghan people have a clear and urgent priority: a ceasefire. An urgent end to the violence will, more than anything else, give us a chance to progress. I would like to take this opportunity to call on every member of the General Assembly and the Permanent Members of the Security Council to help us achieve the end-state of a sovereign, united and democratic Afghanistan, at peace with itself and the region, capable of preserving and expanding the gains of the last 19 years. A democratically stable and prosperous Afghanistan will be an example of how our collective will can overcome the turmoil and uncertainty that defines our world today. Thank You \",\n\"{'Action': 1.2811279814783916e-09, 'ActionObject': 7.6755124478467e-10, 'AgendaStatus': 6.017875087138691e-09, 'Body': 9.182873211832643e-12, 'Clarification': 3.957216776484529e-09, 'Conclusion': 2.964359868684596e-10, 'Election': 4.558744048921426e-09, 'General': 1.0, 'Introduction': 2.5419163662832034e-08, 'MeetingDateTime': 4.570337996945284e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 1.132356763910991e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 1.5096290884031305e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 3.603183085232331e-09, 'MeetingStatus': 1.6075136777260468e-09, 'OralStatement': 1.4727309372020159e-09, 'PresidingOfficer': 8.735100975876264e-10, 'RVRequested': 1.3795594007437462e-11, 'RVTaken': 3.355599825782818e-11, 'Session': 2.245637009679058e-10, 'Sponsorship': 1.0643915610009103e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.5013408011531624e-10, 'Vote': 1.1827319124080304e-09, 'VotingIntention': 5.596548113828703e-09}\",\n[[\"Mohammad Ashraf Ghani\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"this year\", \"DATE\"], [\"75th\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Afghanistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Afghanistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Afghanistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Afghanistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"five\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Afghanistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"4th\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Afghanistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"19th or 20th century\", \"DATE\"], [\"4th\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"5th\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Afghanistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the last 40 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"\\u201cmaintaining international peace and security.\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"Afghanistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"17th\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Just last month\", \"DATE\"], [\"hundreds\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"13\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Two years before\", \"DATE\"], [\"Afghanistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Afghanistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"produce 20,000\", \"PARA\"], [\"produce zero\", \"PARA\"], [\"fifth\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"four\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Afghanistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"four\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"\\u201cfoundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"Afghanistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"five\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"Charter\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Afghanistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the next five years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Afghanistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Afghanistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Afghanistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the last 19 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Afghanistan\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 893,\n            'f': \"893\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.7-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 110,\n            'f': \"110\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.7997357845306396,\n            'f': \"0.7997357845306396\",\n        },\n\"Session\",\n\"Annex X \",\n\"{'Action': 0.04647490754723549, 'ActionObject': 4.5590812375317924e-11, 'AgendaStatus': 8.913470005492141e-15, 'Body': 0.00020527585002128035, 'Clarification': 2.242550112621644e-12, 'Conclusion': 5.301632830662095e-12, 'Election': 0.15344662964344025, 'General': 1.0379739941363854e-14, 'Introduction': 5.235445594848481e-14, 'MeetingDateTime': 3.660073799593988e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 2.2689803813591425e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 8.430606612819247e-08, 'MeetingSegment': 9.461866284254938e-05, 'MeetingStatus': 6.613348091377702e-08, 'OralStatement': 1.2979584421146662e-11, 'PresidingOfficer': 4.402175568518629e-10, 'RVRequested': 1.9659399441707137e-08, 'RVTaken': 1.6456675439258106e-05, 'Session': 0.7997357845306396, 'Sponsorship': 1.414427742929547e-06, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.848280639649147e-09, 'Vote': 2.467512786097359e-05, 'VotingIntention': 4.196464790245935e-12}\",\n[]],\n [{\n            'v': 894,\n            'f': \"894\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.7-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 111,\n            'f': \"111\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999992847442627,\n            'f': \"0.9999992847442627\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Address by Mr. Andrzej Duda, President of the Republic of Poland [Original: Polish; English translation provided by the delegation] Distinguished Mr. President, Excellencies, Esteemed Delegates, I congratulate Mr. Volkan Bozkir, President of the 75th Session of the UN General Assembly on his election to this honourable function and wish to express Poland`s full support for his mission. I would also like to thank Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande for his active presidency over the works of the 74th Session of the UN General Assembly. Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, This year`s 75th Session of the UN General Assembly is an extraordinary one and it will surely go down in history as such. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed not only the course of the event, but has also forced us to embark upon a completely new reflection exercise as well as look for solutions to the problems which the world has not grappled with for years on such a huge scale. International situation is increasingly complicated whereas the palette of challenges and threats we face is constantly growing. Upon completion of its two-year-long mandate in the Security Council last year, Poland continues to be engaged in its areas of priority, also within the framework of its three-year-long term in the Human Rights Council, which commenced this January. Respect for international law, multilateral cooperation of states, international humanitarian law, protection of human rights and taking care of the natural environment are among themes of pivotal importance to Poland. I wish that the adopted anniversary declaration, marking 75 years of the United Nations Organization, not only confirmed the obligations assumed by the founding fathers. I wish that the said declaration was an expression of the longevity of ideas forming the basis of our cooperation and a testimony of the political will to implement them. I wish it was a declaration of \\u201cglobal solidarity\\u201d. Ladies and Gentlemen, Esteemed Delegates, During my first term as Head of State, Poland intensified its presence within the United Nations system. We held a two-year-long mandate in the Security Council, we hosted climate conference COP24 in 2018 whereas our soldiers returned to the UN-peace keeping force in Lebanon, as part of UNIFIL. It was my personal decision that Poland should support \\u2014 in deeds, not just with words \\u2014 the efforts of the international community in the areas of key importance in the contemporary times. The UN has immense achievements in securing peace, containing conflicts, and stabilizing situation in many regions of the world. And we must not let it be squandered. Striving for more effectiveness, reform of the structures and utilizing experiences, including the adjustment of failed solutions, must not serve as a tool for undermining the value of the Organization as a whole. Also, the approach to its individual agendas requires prudence and deep reflection. We share a number of reservations and declare our readiness for a constructive discussion and active engagement while defending the achievements of the UN, which are undeniable and constitute a common political legacy of humanity. Construction through destruction of things that already exist is not only costly, but very risky at the same time. It creates the danger of shaking up the foundations of the strenuously developed rules and values and supplanting traditions as well as historical experiences. Esteemed Delegates, The theme of this year`s session is looking for common and uniting answers to today`s global challenges. Whenever we talk about community building in Poland and discuss common and selfless action in the name of a higher purpose, then there is always one word which springs to mind: SOLIDARITY. This August in Poland we proudly celebrated a splendid anniversary: 40 years since the establishment of \\u201cSolidarity\\u201d \\u2014 a grand social movement which led to the fall of the Iron Curtain and brought liberty, sovereignty and independence to Poland, Polish People as well as to other States and Nations in Central and Eastern Europe, and as a result to the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the demise of the \\u201cevil empire\\u201d \\u2014 that is the Soviet Union. By the same token, the period of the Cold War came to an end. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, the world today would look quite different if it was not for \\u201cSolidarity\\u201d. Therefore, today, 40 years since the establishment of \\u201cSolidarity\\u201d in Poland and 75 years since setting-up of the United Nations Organization, I wish to urge all Heads of State and Government and all Esteemed Delegates to co-create the idea of \\u201cGLOBAL SOLIDARITY\\u201d. This very idea should be the lodestar in our daily mission. I firmly believe that just like the \\u201cSolidarity\\u201d movement in Poland changed the course of history, also the \\u201cGLOBAL SOLIDARITY\\u201d might become the idea which will help to overcome contemporary crises in the world. Three of these are, as far as I`m concerned, especially tangible and acute. The first one is the socio-economic crisis, which results from a phenomenon we were unable to predict and for which we could not comprehensively prepare ourselves, i.e. the coronavirus pandemic. We all have been taken by surprise by how things developed over the last six months. Each and every state has had to face up to completely novel challenges. These have generated not only health related consequences but more broadly also social and economic ones. The fight with the pandemic demands more intensive cooperation and precisely SOLIDARITY. The second one is either the newly emerging or the re-emerging crisis of the quality of relations between states. Unfortunately, it is increasingly the case that the relations turn into a confrontation, rivalry and even imperial domination. The fact that we have managed to avoid another global armed conflict in the last 75 years should doubtlessly be deemed as one of the success stories of the international community. Simultaneously however, one can hardly say that those were the years of global security and global peace. The world was and still is shaken up by various kinds of aggression \\u2014 from terrorist attacks to numerous regional conflicts, many of which have turned over time into the so called frozen conflicts and are incredibly difficult to solve. The policy of strength and aggression is by no means happening exclusively in the peripheries. It is also applied in the region of the world in which my country, Poland is located \\u2014 in our closest neighbourhood. The third crisis results from lack of relevant tools for efficient transformation of economies allowing them to maintain a permanent and stable level of economic growth while taking care of the quality of the natural environment. That definitely is one of the most fundamental challenges facing humanity today and in the nearest future. I believe these crises will remain unsolved unless we focus on the idea of Therefore, it is important to make sure that the fight against inter alia the impact of the coronavirus pandemic does not result in deeper economic divisions among states and societies; that it does not assume the form of a ruthless economic rivalry and result in the wealthier ones getting richer at the cost of the poorer. By the same token however, that fight must not lead to constraining the sphere of our liberty whereas access to medical solutions must not depend on the size of the wallet. Ladies and Gentlemen, I urge you to act together. In the name of SOLIDARITY Poland deployed, at the height of the pandemic, a number of military medical missions, among others to Italy and the United States, in order to help, acquire and share the knowledge on how to fight the pandemic and better respond to potential future crises. Counteracting the economic dimension of the pandemic was one of the themes of a letter which I sent to European leaders in late April this year. In the letter I requested that, in the course of their economic recovery efforts, our governments care, more resolutely than before, not merely about robust GDP growth, but also about sustainable development of the countries in other aspects, including fair and efficient distribution of funds among those in need. Moreover, I urged European leaders to give together a new impulse to stimulate production in Europe, which would undoubtedly shorten supply chains, among other things. If we want to be, once again, a great innovative \\u201cproduction workshop\\u201d we must act together. From the perspective of our economic subjectivity this is of strategic importance. Ladies and Gentlemen, In terms of the crisis in the quality of relations among states, I wish to stress that one of Poland`s unchanging priorities is the question of respect for international law. There cannot and there will not be a lasting peace in the world unless law is abided by. Our attachment to this value is mirrored by the slogan \\u201cpeace through law\\u201d, which we promoted inter alia during our two-year-long term as an elected member state of the Security Council. In our actions undertaken in the UN forum we are consistent in highlighting the fundamental role of international law in preserving the global security architecture. It is indispensable to ensure cooperation among states in a situation when the fundamental norms of international law are violated, for instance in case of the aggression of the Russian Federation on Georgia or Ukraine. Another concerning phenomenon refers to the violation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons, which was repeatedly the case in recent years. Poland did not and does not accept the fact that chemical weapons are still in use. On top of that, and that is even more concerning: the infringement of the Convention in 2018 coincided with the violation of the fundamental principle of international law: sovereignty and territorial integrity. It is upon our shoulders: those of the UN, the Security Council and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons that the responsibility rests to communicate to the world our strong opposition in this matter. It is only through the enforcement of the fundamental principles and norms of international law enshrined among others in the Declaration on Principles of International Law adopted by the General Assembly half a century ago, will we succeed in building lasting peace and a safe world of equal states and free nations with no spheres of influence. Leaving cases of violation of international law, including interference in sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, unanswered by the international community will every time act as an encouragement to repeat such negative behaviour. Infringement of the norms of international law must result in consequences whereas those responsible must be held accountable. Poland keeps underlining, in an incessant and consistent manner, the importance and the unique role of two other sub-areas of international law: human rights and international humanitarian law. International humanitarian law and human rights are among greatest achievements of the international community in its striving to limit suffering and ensure respect for the rights of the civilian population in armed conflicts. The dissemination of the role of international humanitarian law is high on the agenda of the priorities of Polish foreign policy in recent years. Therefore, I have appealed to the international community, through the UN Human Rights Council in which Poland currently holds a three year-long mandate, to pay attention to the violation of human rights in Belarus. I am glad that the Council has held a meeting dedicated to this issue. In the name of SOLIDARITY we should all speak with one voice and demand that fundamental human rights be respected both in Belarus and in other places across the globe. Repressions of political opponents, mass detentions of peaceful protesters or violence and torture being applied against them cannot be tolerated in any state. Belarusians, just like any other free nation, have the right to shape their political future in a sovereign way, without external interference, without domination of other capitals, with the right to freely participate in international cooperation in line with their national interests. The third on the list of crises in today`s world is inadequate balancing of the environmental changes while staying on the path of economic development. We firmly believe it is necessary to create a more resilient, inclusive and environment- friendly economy. As a three-time host of the UN climate conferences: COP14 in Pozna\\u0144 in 2008, COP19 in Warsaw in 2013 and COP24 in Katowice in 2018, Poland is committed to fight with environmental changes. At the same time, we argue that on the path leading to the attainment of the agreed goals we have to make sure that our actions are safe for the citizens, economies and states. We need a climate friendly transition, which will be fair and balanced and take domestic conditions of every state into account. We have already launched a transition aimed at ensuring a just green and low-emission economy. We know however that in this effort it is impossible to be successful on your own. It requires responsible cooperation of us all. Ladies and Gentlemen, Esteemed Delegates, In view of the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, fragile and too frequently violated international law and the need to transform our economies, we should be led by more than just the principle of common responsibility. These days it is also important to act in accordance with the ideals of SOLIDARITY. Poland invites all UN members to act in solidarity while countering the crises which are currently affecting us.

When the representatives of 51 nations, including mine, signed the Charter of the United Nations in San Francisco on 26 June 1945, the world was still in flames. The horrors unleashed by the Second World War were still atrocious realities against which the international community conspired so they would never happen again. As a result of that commitment to peace and dialogue among peoples, this Organization was born in whose General Assembly I am honored to participate today for the first time on behalf of the Dominican people, and in whose name I congratulate the United Nations on its 75th Anniversary. The world of 2020 is evidently different from that of 1945 and I am confident to proclaim that it is also better. And it is so, to a large extent, thanks to the United Nations effort during these three quarters of a century to maintain international peace and security, encourage cooperation between peoples to solve global problems and serve, ultimately, as meeting point for the nations that share this planet. Without the UN the Universal Declaration of Human Rights would not exist, something inconceivable for us today; neither would we have organizations like UNICEF, FAO, the World Health Organization, the World Bank or international criminal courts. Nor would have been carried out the peacekeeping missions that, through its history, have avoided so much suffering. The world of 2020 is better than in 1945 but far from perfect. New challenges and threats bring global problems whose scale requires joint solutions that can only be solved through loyal cooperation among the 193 nations represented in this Assembly. 75 years ago, the international community had to take on the colossal challenge posed by reconstruction after the ravages of war, which in turn brought about additional obstacles that required commitment, imagination and work to overcome. However, it would be reckless to deceive ourselves. History is not linear; at every crossroads there is always the risk of setbacks that hinder goals achieved towards development, progress and peace, which are always so hard to reach. Therefore, as leaders and servants of our respective nations, we must know there is zero margin of error if we intend to face the challenges of our time in our own way and alone. If in the 75 years of the UN\\u2019s existence, multilateralism and international cooperation have been valuable tools, now they are essential and it is imperative that everyone do their part. That this meeting of the General Assembly has to be held by videoconference is already the perfect example of the main problem we, as leaders and servants of our respective peoples, must face. COVID-19 has put the entire planet in check joining threats such as climate change, which affects us all, but it is highly serious in island countries like the Dominican Republic. I am not exaggerating if I say that both dangers could bring other conflicts into the equation; which will, as usual, viciously prey upon the most vulnerable. As a non-permanent member of the Security Council, the Dominican Republic has made a special contribution to the agenda of the Protection of Civilians in Conflict in the Context of COVID-19 through a Presidential Declaration that had the unanimous agreement of the Council. That is the spirit that should prevail in the immediate future when it comes to carrying out the policies allowing us to stop the pandemic first, extend treatment and vaccination later, and in the meantime, rebuilding what the pandemic has damaged. In the Dominican Republic, the pandemic has hit us particularly hard because we have had a precarious social protection system, with per capita social spending of $604 compared to the regional average of $941. While the paradox exists that we are one of the nations with the highest economic growth in the region, it has not managed, so far, to close the equity gap. We all here know, the equity gap will only be fixed by investing in Health and Education. This is why my Government is launching the most ambitious public health program in our history to achieve universal coverage by the end of the year as we increase public investment in the National Health System. Along with this, there is a plan to promote quality Education that, among other measures, will provide students and teachers with electronic devices so that Covid-19 does not disturb at all their educational process. The future does not wait, and our students cannot miss a minute of their learning. And this is why our young people are one of our top priorities; we will work to ensure they get the best education. In this sense, I believe there is no better education than a comprehensive one that encourages students\\u2019 participation in all areas affecting them. Proof of this is the acceptance of the Dominican-French initiative to promote resolution 2535 (2020) \\u2014 adopted unanimously by the Security Council in July 2020 \\u2014 to strengthen the member states\\u2019 commitment to the global agenda of youth, peace and security and that directly involves young people in these plans. However, talking about peace and security without talking about development is, simply and plainly, wasting time. Before the pandemic this Organization was already in a reform process to assist Member States in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda. It is evident that achieving these objectives requires an \\u201caccelerated implementation\\u201d with the purposeful commitment of the developed countries. However, five years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, the majority of developing countries are lagging behind, and those middle-income nations \\u2013 such as the Dominican Republic\\u2014 face particular challenges, because although their economies are advancing institutional weaknesses prevail that lead to inequality. It is therefore essential to modify that Agenda so it responds to the reality and problems facing each country. The Dominican Republic will spare no effort with the 2030 Agenda, because for years our country has been implementing a National Development Strategy that shares objectives with the United Nations Agenda. Yet, I recognize, to achieve full compliance in just ten years is a challenge requiring the collaboration of all civil society, with public-private collaboration with a national vision, and keeping in mind the essential assistance needed by lagging countries. 75 years ago, this organization was born with the purpose of banishing forever from the international community\\u2019s vocabulary the \\u201cwe\\u201d versus \\u201cyou\\u201d or \\u201cthem\\u201d to assume the \\u201ceveryone\\u201d. And this is what COVID-19 intends to put to the test. But I predict it will fail if this Assembly assumes the threat will be annulled through policies not combining the legitimate national interests of each country with the global solutions adopted by the entire international community. To do this, we must act in three areas: Health, Education and Technology. In the field of Health, this meeting should help create the conditions of universal access to the vaccine against COVID-19 as soon as the remedy is available. From here, WE DEMAND that the vaccine be accessible to all human beings on the planet. The reason for the creation of an organization like this is to measure up to historical challenges such as this one. To achieve this, the role of the World Health Organization is essential, as well as the creation of a global solidarity fund that will serve as a reserve to mitigate the ravages of future pandemics. In the field of schooling, we must share the most positive experiences, including online education, skills training and support investment efforts in educational policies. Finally, the UN must be the engine and guide so that the 21st century is truly the century of knowledge thanks to ever advancing communication technologies. Hence, ending the digital divide is one of the urgent priorities for the international community. However, all development and all progress will be useless if the values enshrined by this Organization in its Universal Declaration of Human Rights are not taken into account. The UN knows that it has the solid commitment of the Dominican Republic to defend these values; to advance towards higher levels of human dignity that promote policies to guarantee equality between men and women, as well as protect children affected by armed conflicts, or at risk of being sold as slaves, prostituted or used for pornography. Appalling realities happening on our planet today, that we have a moral mandate to eradicate once and for all. Ladies and Gentlemen: I bring to this meeting the mandate of the Dominican people to proclaim our nation\\u2019s commitment to protecting the environment and to continue supporting the Paris Agreements. Furthermore, I believe the time has come to enhance its postulates. In the Security Council, we have advocated that security factors within the Climate Change context be more broadly and in-depth studied, because a natural phenomenon can cause or aggravate any conflict, mainly in highly fragile areas. The occurrence of natural phenomena and extreme climatic events are becoming more frequent and their greater intensity particularly affects the small island developing states. Which forces this Organization to continue on the path of not considering such phenomena as isolated eventualities, but as common and recurrent realities for which we must be ready. The list of threats and complications can scare anyone. However, this organization has demonstrated over three-quarters of a century that, through dialogue and cooperation, any goal can be achieved, no matter how remote it may seem. Whoever thinks one can change the world by one\\u2019s self is wrong, and whoever does not know how to measure one\\u2019s strength to adjust our contribution will also be wrong. Therefore, on behalf of Dominican men and women, I share our deep commitment, purpose and work to provide solutions to the best of our ability. Close to eleven million Dominicans are eager to do their part. The Dominican Republic was in the founding hour of this Organization and, since then, has demonstrated its will and commitment in the concert of nations for the sake of peace, prosperity, equity and global diversity. We are aware of our demographic and economic reality, but our condition will never be an excuse for not contributing the best of ourselves as we have tried to do for 75 years. The UN, as I understand it, is not concerned with diplomacy, but with the future and, as Eleanor Roosevelt said on the day of the solemn proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \\u201cthe future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of your dreams\\u201d. Let us therefore attain a world in peace, diverse, prosperous and sustainable for at least 75 more years. Thank you very much. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.0697267960324552e-08, 'ActionObject': 4.656794505564221e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 2.194334491889549e-08, 'Body': 6.11226277924537e-11, 'Clarification': 1.686824546709431e-08, 'Conclusion': 1.0514499271252475e-09, 'Election': 2.052895631265983e-08, 'General': 0.9999998807907104, 'Introduction': 5.632156074852901e-08, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.6449633594438637e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 5.6374620527321895e-09, 'MeetingNumber': 7.623090492181461e-10, 'MeetingSegment': 1.867440246883234e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 7.538062618550612e-09, 'OralStatement': 1.0669881866931519e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 3.1686271384501197e-09, 'RVRequested': 5.865405383609357e-11, 'RVTaken': 2.197817067228769e-10, 'Session': 1.2987809716591414e-09, 'Sponsorship': 8.446188193289572e-10, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.6426271454150765e-09, 'Vote': 4.853970114737649e-09, 'VotingIntention': 2.402257948119768e-08}\",\n[[\"Luis Rodolfo Abinader Corona\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the Dominican Republic\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Antonio\", \"PERSON\"], [\"75th\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"51\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"26 June 1945\", \"DATE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"75th Anniversary\", \"DATE\"], [\"2020\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"1945\", \"DATE\"], [\"these three quarters of a century\", \"DATE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"2020\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"1945\", \"DATE\"], [\"193\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"75 years ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"zero\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the 75 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"the Dominican Republic\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the Dominican Republic\", \"UNPE\"], [\"first\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"the Dominican Republic\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the end of the year\", \"DATE\"], [\"a minute\", \"TIME\"], [\"comprehensive one\", \"PARA\"], [\"resolution 2535\", \"R\"], [\"2020\", \"DATE\"], [\"July 2020\", \"DATE\"], [\"2030\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"\\u201caccelerated implementation\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"five years\", \"DATE\"], [\"2030\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the Dominican Republic\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Agenda\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Dominican Republic\", \"UNPE\"], [\"2030\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"years\", \"DATE\"], [\"just ten years\", \"DATE\"], [\"75 years ago\", \"DATE\"], [\"\\u201cwe\\u201d versus \\u201cyou\\u201d or \\u201cthem\\u201d to assume the \\u201ceveryone\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"], [\"three\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"the 21st century\", \"DATE\"], [\"truly the century\", \"DATE\"], [\"the Dominican Republic\", \"UNPE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"a century\", \"DATE\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"on behalf of\", \"Entity_MOD\"], [\"Close to eleven million\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Dominican Republic\", \"UNPE\"], [\"the founding hour\", \"TIME\"], [\"75 years\", \"DATE\"], [\"Eleanor Roosevelt\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the day\", \"DATE\"], [\"\\u201cthe future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of your dreams\\u201d\", \"Entitled\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 897,\n            'f': \"897\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.7-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 114,\n            'f': \"114\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.985800564289093,\n            'f': \"0.985800564289093\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Annex XII \",\n\"{'Action': 1.1299616744508967e-06, 'ActionObject': 2.8701725440782866e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 8.126918693562857e-09, 'Body': 2.2076605432630458e-07, 'Clarification': 6.499147886529499e-09, 'Conclusion': 2.98109654295331e-07, 'Election': 2.3891570890555158e-05, 'General': 0.985800564289093, 'Introduction': 1.1690988088730592e-07, 'MeetingDateTime': 8.653336713848603e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 1.1018955774488859e-05, 'MeetingNumber': 1.6548947314731777e-06, 'MeetingSegment': 0.007472908589988947, 'MeetingStatus': 8.171593890438089e-08, 'OralStatement': 2.1017383389221322e-09, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.3795537157079707e-08, 'RVRequested': 7.891740949617088e-08, 'RVTaken': 4.759474165894062e-07, 'Session': 0.006667531095445156, 'Sponsorship': 4.167470990523725e-07, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 1.3196209402988046e-10, 'Vote': 1.9266633898951113e-05, 'VotingIntention': 9.132326539429414e-08}\",\n[]],\n [{\n            'v': 898,\n            'f': \"898\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.7-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 115,\n            'f': \"115\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999994039535522,\n            'f': \"0.9999994039535522\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Address by Mr. Nicol\\u00e1s Maduro Moros, President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela [Original: Spanish; English translation provided by the delegation] H.E. Mr. Volkan Bozkir, President of the General Assembly, H.E. Mr. Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres, Secretary-General, Heads of State, Heads of Government, Authorities participating in this 75th Session of the UN General Assembly, At the outset, I want to apologize for removing my face mask, which is necessary in this time of pandemic, and I want to greet all who watch and listen to us around the world. Allow me to congratulate you, Mr. President, on behalf of the Constitutional Government of Venezuela and the People of our Bolivarian Republic for assuming the Presidency of this 75th Session of the General Assembly. A great occasion of great importance due to the stellar situation that humanity is going through caused by this world emergency generated by the COVID-19. I say a stellar situation because, in addition to posing serious difficulties for the complex planetary order, it is also an opportunity to reflect on and promote the change of paradigms that humanity itself, especially the great majorities who are vulnerable to poverty and exclusion, expect so much from us, so much from world leaders. In this same General Assembly, in 2001, our Eternal Commander Hugo Ch\\u00e1vez said, \\u201cWe come, then, without fear, in good faith and with much optimism about life, brotherhood, unity and the possibility that we, as the leaders of our countries, can seek, grasp and build together real solutions to real problems in the quest for justice and peace.\\u201d From Venezuela, we believe that the world must be completely revised, with a great magnifying glass said Commander Ch\\u00e1vez; a very powerful magnifying glass, because the world has become very bad, it has been stumbling from one mistake to another. It was a call made by Commander Ch\\u00e1vez in 2001, to take a sense of reality in the re-founding of the United Nations Organization. And we have arrived at 2020, insisting on this need for renewal of the paradigms. Venezuela recognizes that, in these 75 years, the United Nations Organization has given great contributions to humanity. However, we demand more will and efforts to preserve the achievements, to advance in new objectives. We insist on the need to strengthen South-South cooperation and to create alternative mechanisms for financing and technical support that will back up the initiatives and priorities defined by our peoples to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. This is a timely and urgent task and every day counts. \\u201cThe South also thinks, the South also matters, the South also exists\\u201d, as the poet Benedetti said, from his centennial presence. We must all work to save our planet. We make a call to achieve the highest political commitment to fight climate change which is a reality and an urgent priority. We recognize the importance of strengthening mitigation and adaptation actions, in accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. We therefore reaffirm the importance of the means of implementation for developing countries to carry out their climate actions. Noam Chomsky recently warned, \\u201cthere is not much time left\\u201d. Mr. President, The United Nations and humanity as a whole face a deep and complex crisis, combining the COVID-19 pandemic with the global climate change challenges and sustainable development. Added to this disturbing scenario is the no less alarming claim of the great powers to lead humanity into direct confrontation in the military sphere. This would be, perhaps, the last one for our species. The United States of America, far from taking a positive or proactive leadership position, conducts itself erratically under a government that is intransigent and hostile to diplomacy and high politics, since it openly disregards multilateralism and any type of pre-existing global rule. The COVID-19 pandemic has come to change the realities and priorities of all humanity, because of its consequences for human life. The pandemic has made evident the inequalities in the world and exacerbated them. Unfortunately, some contingency measures in the face of the pandemic have increased the social and economic gaps within countries. That is why the international community, as a whole, must provide a global and coordinated response to support all nations in need, helping to create the conditions for stronger economies and more inclusive societies. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the collapse of the international geopolitical and geo-economic order was already taking place. However, this emergency has made us aware of and critically think about the contradictions of capitalism and its logical and operational inability to deal with these crises. In many cases, the States were reduced to a minimum expression and the imposed neo-liberalism suffocated the public institutions, turning the rights of the people into private services; health became a luxury. Let us hear in the streets of the world the fury of the peoples who feel orphaned and unprotected! The health and well-being of the population are not merchandise; the market cannot continue to regulate the destiny of humanity! Venezuela believes that the role of the World Health Organization (WHO) should be an example of multilateralism that we need to strengthen. The WHO must be an organization that acts and speaks faithfully, without bowing to pressure, extortion and attacks from the powerful; that confirms its moral authority, its scientific capacity and cooperation based on solidarity. We welcome the enormous scientific efforts of sisterly nations such as Russia, China and Cuba in creating an effective and safe vaccine against COVID-19, and we trust that such findings will be considered a global public good by each of our nations, with free access for all the peoples of the world, without discrimination. From the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, we propose the creation of a revolving public purchasing fund within the United Nations System to guarantee access to food and health products, financed with public resources. This will make it possible to face discrimination and the economic blockade against countries by making it easier for governments to acquire necessary goods and services. We call for the strengthening of financing policies and funds aimed at the development of local production chains and new economic actors, as well as the creation of a bank of free technologies and universal education and training processes. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela advocates the adoption of a legally binding international instrument on development and the right to development, which will strengthen the struggle of peoples to overcome poverty and social inequalities and for social justice. Our re-election as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council, by the sovereign and majority votes of the countries represented in the United Nations System \\u2014 despite the incessant attacks by the U.S. empire and its satellites \\u2014 has reaffirmed our commitment to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people, without distinction of any kind and in a fair and equitable manner, strongly supporting any initiative in the fight against ethnic, gender, nationality and other related forms of intolerance. We are committed to upholding the principles of universality, impartiality, objectivity, non-politicization, and non- selectivity in their implementation. We are committed to international, intercultural, constructive, and cooperative dialogue to advance the promotion and protection of all human rights, including, of course, the right to comprehensive development of peoples. Mr. President, The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ratifies its commitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the principles set forth in the United Nations Charter and, in that sense, in relation to the territorial dispute over Guayana Esequiba, Venezuela reiterates its strict adherence to the Geneva Agreement of 1966. In particular, we emphasize the object, purpose, and reason for the Geneva Agreement, which clearly mandates reaching a practical, satisfactory, and mutually acceptable solution through successive mechanisms provided for in Article 33 of the United Nations Charter. It is through political, diplomatic and mutually agreed upon negotiation that we will reach the solution of this dispute inherited from imperial colonialism. Mr. President, The world has continued to face many injustices that affect innocent peoples, threatening their extermination; actions of States that are unjustified and inadmissible and that embarrass humanity. Let us once again reiterate our support and solidarity with the Arab people of Palestine and demand respect for their historic territories established in 1967 by this United Nations Organization. We support the call of the United Nations to put an end to the infamous, criminal, almost 60-year-old blockade against our sisterly nation of Cuba and, in this regard, we reaffirm the call to the U.S. government to immediately put an end to the economic, commercial and financial blockade it imposes on our sisterly nation. Mr. President, The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reiterates its commitment to the need to promote and strengthen dialogue and cooperation by building bridges among peoples, respecting cultural and religious differences, through conflict prevention, reconciliation and peacebuilding. The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) has promoted the recognition of these initiatives, policies and values, with the celebration of the International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace, and has joined the Group of Friends of the UN Alliance of Civilizations, who are waving the flags of pluralism and equity. There is still much to be done, and we will do it. Mr. President, Venezuela, as you know, is under constant attack. Our beloved Homeland is the victim of a multiform attack by the U.S. Empire, in the media field, in the political field, in the economic field; we have even been threatened with direct military aggressions. The unilateral measures imposed by the Government of the United States of America have tried to subdue the Venezuelan people. However, our people, together with the Constitutional Government, have heroically resisted the opprobrium, the illegality, the inhumanity of an empire which today represents the most serious threat facing the multi-polar and multi-centered world. Today, standing up, and with the dignity of the people, children of the glories of the Liberator Simon Bolivar, we say to the supremacist Government of the United States that the world is watching them, that the 21st century has millions of eyes that see beyond the media matrices. There is still time to return to international legality. We tell you that you are still in time to reverse the discredit and global malaise that your arbitrariness and arrogance provoke in the conscious world. Continuing on the path of violation of the United Nations Charter will lead them inexorably to the isolation, discredit and condemnation of the history of peoples, including that of their own people, the people of the United States, who have taken to the streets to protest against racism, against police brutality, against abuse. Unilateral coercive measures have awakened not only the indignation and repudiation of the peoples against the alleged global dictatorship raised from the United States, which is trying to impose on us, but have also generated cohesion and national initiatives around new forms of production, technical and technological solutions. Inventiveness has been the answer to the persecution of our national industry. This is what the real Venezuelan is like, of flesh and bone, who is so hidden and who they try so hard to despise. Today I can tell you, Excellency that a revolution of innovation has been unleashed in our Homeland, a new offensive to transform into a virtuous cycle of opportunities the attempts of aggression to make our nation collapse. We have made a titanic effort with our own capacities, in addition to the solidarity and cooperation of friendly countries and the United Nations System to confront the entire COVID-19 pandemic situation. We have avoided the worst, despite the plans, prognoses and catastrophic wishes of those who attack us. Neither the illegal blockade, nor the aggressions against our government have distracted us and prevented us from fulfilling a great effort: the goal of protecting the lives of our population. Today we can say that we have applied about 1.9 million free tests, which has represented, today, the average of 62,489 tests per million inhabitants. We can say that we are the Latin American and Caribbean country that has carried out the most tests on its people; we say this with humility and with the desire to always help the neighboring countries from whom, with frequency, we only receive aggressions from their governments. This, which is a Venezuelan truth, you will not hear it, you will not see it on the front pages of the traditional media, much less in the social networks or on the Internet; the blockade is also communicational. That is why I want to stop and share our experience that could save lives in other places on the planet, just as the experience of China, Cuba and Russia has done with us. Our social and health protection system allows us to go house to house to look for positive cases and to attend to suspicious or potential cases. We count on it; with the medical missions and the automatized protection system called Patria Web System, where more than 20 million citizens, adults, of a population of 30 million inhabitants, are registered, equivalent, as you can see, to more than two thirds of the population. This territorial system has allowed us to reach all the communities in our country. We have our own model, designed on the principle of prioritizing the lives of all equally. Thanks to this, we have been able to combine a healthy distance with the productive life of the country. We have called it the \\u201cSeven by Seven System\\u201d and we make it available to all nations, with the modesty that characterizes us. Seven days: a week of shelter in the homes, of deep quarantine, and seven days, a week of economic flexibility, broad and general; which ensures the implementation of a new normality, until we can overcome this pandemic. Our government has prepared to face this challenge together with our people; we have the superior level of awareness that the Venezuelan population has accumulated and the efficiency of our public health system. In this way, we have been able to control the first signs of this pandemic that has battered the world, gaining time to improve all the protocols for prevention, treatment and protection of our people. Venezuela is one of the few countries to apply free and differentiated treatment for the cases detected: asymptomatic, mild symptomatic, moderate symptomatic and severe symptomatic. Our policy of prevention and attention implies the total hospitalization of all positive cases, even when they do not present symptoms. This has prevented us from the exponential expansion of this disease. Mr. President, More than $30 billion dollars have been taken from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, frozen and held in bank accounts in the United States and Europe. Likewise, any company or government that commercializes any good or service with our country be food, medicine, fuel, additives needed to produce gasoline \\u2014 which our people need \\u2014 etc., is being persecuted. That is why we ratify to the world that Venezuela has prepared to resist and is resisting this offensive of criminal, inhumane aggression. Venezuela has prepared to overcome this blockade by the government of the United States of North America. It is a battle for pace, for our Homeland, for the region, for humanity. Our heroic Venezuelan people has assumed in the past the responsibility of its historical role before the ignominy of the most dangerous empire of the universal history; an empire that at the same time is writing the most horrifying chapters of inhumanity and criminal imposition. The world must know that we are prepared to fight them with the force of our history, our spirit, reason and international law. I wish to reiterate once again our deep appreciation for the pronouncement of both the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, demanding the immediate lifting of unilateral and criminal coercive measures, which are not only contrary to the United Nations Charter, but are clear obstacles imposed on the affected countries to adequately address the COVID-19 pandemic and the compliance with the Sustainable Development Goals. The attacks \\u2014 as you know \\u2014 are not limited only to the unilateral coercive measures. On 3 May, Venezuela faced an attempted maritime incursion by a group of mercenaries and terrorists, financed by the government of the United States and trained on Colombian territory, with the total and absolute support of the U.S. and Colombian governments. This group of terrorists was confronted in real time by the civic-military police union, and the perpetrators of this attack, of this armed incursion against Venezuela, were neutralized and captured, and are under the orders of the judicial institutions for due process. Likewise, we recently captured an American spy with war weapons and documents related to our oil and electric industry. It is a daily siege that we have been facing, dismantling, denouncing, unveiling one by one. And I ask myself: How can a terrorist action be qualified in the midst of an extraordinary humanitarian circumstance such as the one we are living with the COVID-19 pandemic? Can humanity qualify it? The least we can say is that the excess has been imposed, which is the most terrible sin that seems to have taken over completely the North American elites. That is why the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reiterates the need to vindicate the principles of respect for sovereignty, for the self-determination of the peoples, expressed in the United Nations Charter, which unite us all, whose illegal violation by some Member States of this Organization, motivated by ignoble reasons, is endangering the stability of our country and the Latin-Caribbean region. It is necessary that the countries that defend peace activate themselves and make the Government of the United States understand that, in the midst of a pandemic, no one understands nor explain that there is an upsurge of criminal prosecution, of the blockade against noble countries such as Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Syria, Iran and other brotherly countries of the world. For this reason, we must demand the cessation of all unilateral coercive measures, of all the alleged sanctions, and that they allow our peoples exercise their own rights, the right to development and peace. The United States and its Government must abandon the old practice of criminalizing those of us who do not subordinate to their orders in this world and maintain, as we do it, a policy of independence and sovereignty. The United States \\u2014 we must say this \\u2014 in the course history, has become the most serious threat to peace in this world. We wish to endorse the words of the United Nations Secretary-General Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres, on the ceasefire and cessation of conflicts in the world, reiterating unrestricted respect and full adherence to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and international law, in particular, respect to sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of States, dialogue among nations, the peaceful resolution of disputes and the prohibition of the threats or use of force as such. Mr. President, Venezuela has traditionally been a host country of refugees and migrants. However, as a direct consequence of the criminal unilateral coercive measures and the economic aggressions imposed by the government of the United States on our people, a process of migration of citizens has taken place, fundamentally for economic reasons. Nevertheless, at present, our country is facing and experiencing a wave of voluntary, massive returns of thousands of Venezuelan migrants, from the countries with very high levels of COVID-19 infections, such as Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Brazil, motivated by different reasons, the most important being the failure of COVID-19 management in those countries. Secondly, the systematic violation of the human rights of Venezuelan migrants, anachronistic and xenophobic policies against migrants of our country, including from high levels of government in those countries; discrimination, mistreatment, lack of socio-economic conditions, a situation of semi-slavery, human trafficking, calamities that our migrants have suffered in clear violation of their human dignity. What has been the reaction of the world \\u2013 we wonder \\u2013 that says to be concerned for Venezuela in the face of these reprehensible facts: complicit silence. As we said, the COVID-19 pandemic has catalysed the already unsustainable living conditions of thousands of migrants in the so-called host countries, who have reported the worsening of abandonment and the lack of response and attention from the authorities in those countries. The fragility of the social protection systems of these countries has become evident, and they are sometimes presented as social and economic models. And we wonder once again, how is it possible, despite the great amount of dollars that have been given to these governments through extravagant donor recruitment conferences for Venezuelan migrants? What did they do with that money? Did these governments steal it? We believe that we must certainly review, with institutional and scientific rigour the role that some United Nations Agencies, or some people from some Agencies, have been playing in these processes, such as UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Mr. President, For the sake of the reconciliation and complying with the agreements reached in the National Dialogue Table between the Venezuelan political forces, in September 2019, a series of measures have been adopted to benefit and guarantee democracy in Venezuela. Recently, 110 citizens belonging to right-wing opposition groups were pardoned and prosecuted for several crimes related to aggression against our country. With this decision, we seek to continue building the path towards national reconciliation, understanding that peace deserves all efforts and we will not cease, Mr. President, in our commitment to this task. In faithful compliance with the provisions established in our National Constitution, approved in a referendum by the Venezuelan People in December 1999, the 25th democratic election in 20 years will be held next Sunday, December 6th, 2020. This time, to renew the Legislative Power, with the participation of more than 14,400 candidates, from more than 107 political organizations from the entire national ideological spectrum. In Venezuela, I can tell you, there are all the necessary guarantees to hold the parliamentary elections and that is why we have invited the world to join us, to be witnesses of a living democracy, nothing and nobody will be able to take away from the Venezuelan people the right to elect the new Legislative Power, since this is a fundamental tool for collective existence and will be an expression of the will of the original power. No one decides for us Venezuelans; we do not intervene nor do we intend to do so in any case \\u2014 ever \\u2014 before any other nation, we are respectful and thus we demand respect. Even so, the Government of Washington, which has led its own people to the collapse of the pandemic \\u2014 which, by the way, will hold presidential elections next November, in blatant violation of international law, illegally imposed new unilateral coercive measures against the Venezuelan democratic institutions, in this case, the Electoral Power, to try to interfere with the conduct of the parliamentary election provided for in our Constitution. This is why, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reiterates the need to vindicate the principles of respect to sovereignty and self determination of the peoples, expressed in the United Nations Charter, whose illegal violation by some Member States of this Organization is intended to lead Venezuela to violence and conflict. We will not allow it. We demand respect. The Venezuelan path is of peace, democracy, freedom, vote, participation and protagonism of the people. That is how it has been, and that is how it will be. Mr. President, Authorities of the world, Heads of State, Heads of Government, Here is Venezuela standing. With its historical dignity, in peace. Ready for new challenges; ready for new victories. I bid you farewell, wishing for union, peace and cooperation of the whole world. Thank you very much. \",\n\"{'Action': 1.383104208940722e-08, 'ActionObject': 8.026901809898845e-09, 'AgendaStatus': 4.678490483911446e-08, 'Body': 1.5033067846115244e-10, 'Clarification':

United Nations General Assembly His Excellency Mr. Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations Heads of State and Government Distinguished delegates, History has taught us that decisions made in times of crisis define and leave their mark on the world for decades. In other words, the great trials of humankind, such as pandemics, have forced us to break with the past, to imagine a new world. This pandemic is no different. It is a portal \\u2014 the bridge between one world and the next. World leaders today face a number of extraordinary and monumental challenges. In the short, medium and long term, COVID-19 has put the paradigms of today\\u2019s society to the test and challenges us to actively build the future we want. This implies changes in our economic systems, leadership and governance, transparency, protection and restoration of biodiversity, human rights and social inclusion. Ladies and gentlemen, COVID-19 has highlighted contradictions in public policy, throughout the world, and reveals that a post-pandemic world must be sustainable and better. The decisions we make today will have long-term consequences. Doing more of the same is simply unsustainable. That would mean disregarding the scale of human suffering that the pandemic has unleashed. This crisis is unnerving \\u2014 in part because it has new and unfamiliar characteristics. It is a global health emergency. However, the most worrisome part of the pandemic is not new. COVID-19 has highlighted deep inequalities that already exist. Although the pandemic affects us all, not all of us are affected equally. We must all focus on poverty and inequality. If in the past some chose to ignore them, it is now impossible not to acknowledge their harsh reality. Let us be clear. The post-pandemic world will continue with the same problems we face now, but under increasingly extreme conditions. The post-pandemic world will be different only if, going forward, even amid this battle, we take mitigation measures and focus on laying the foundations to resolve these issues and bring about deep structural change. If we learn the right lessons from this crisis, we will be able to achieve the social consensus that will allow us to accelerate the reforms needed to achieve a society that is prosperous, and above all, just and more united. Ladies and gentlemen, One of the main lessons learned from the pandemic is the importance of trusting science, technology and innovation to provide solutions that allow us to close existing social gaps. The circumstances created by the pandemic enabled the rapid implementation of innovative systems. Learning processes have been accelerated as never before, leading to greater return on the State\\u2019s investment in innovation. This is particularly true in the digital economy, reflected in the shift to methods, such as telecommuting or the consumption of services and products ordered and delivered online and by courier. It is also seen in the application of first-world digital educational platforms, which we now use in some of our public schools or in the practice of telemedicine, which allows citizens in remote areas to receive medical care from specialists hundreds of kilometres away. Ladies and gentlemen, An increase in unemployment is a serious consequence of the health crisis. Here, too, there is an important opportunity for our economies, which are based primarily on informal work, as the groundwork is laid and the necessary changes are made in public policies to build the future we want \\u2014 one focused on entrepreneurship and the formalization of employment. In a post-COVID-19 world, shared prosperity can be the result of a common vision of global solidarity. The most important lesson from the pandemic is that of working together on problems that affect humankind. Without a doubt, we are stronger together than apart. Let us remember that after the Second World War, it was the need to survive, rebuild economies and prevent the scourge of a new war that brought countries together to create a new international order. The pandemic has again produced that de facto solidarity. We have seen how international cooperation has been mobilized through concrete actions by countries. For example, scientists from Asia, Europe and the Americas share information and experiences. Ladies and gentlemen, As the country with the best maritime and air connectivity in Latin America and the Caribbean, Panama has done the same in its position as hub of the Americas, by allowing its infrastructure to be used by the world \\u2014 maintaining the 144 maritime routes and 1,700 ports served by its Canal. We have kept our port and airport open, thereby ensuring the continuity of logistics chains for global supplies, in particular of food and medicine. We demonstrated our solidarity by providing humanitarian assistance and allowing the Zandaam and Rotterdam cruise ships, which were affected by COVID-19, to transit the Panama Canal so that their passengers could be treated in time, thereby preventing a greater tragedy. We allowed our infrastructure to be used by the region, thereby making it possible for humanitarian assistance in the form of supplies, medicines and medical equipment to be distributed to more than 30 countries through the Regional Logistics Center, the United Nations World Food Programme and the International Red Cross. Only together, with solidarity and cooperation, can we move forward. If the international community fails to respond now, in a decisive manner, the United Nations 2030 Agenda could be derailed. A new multilateral order requires genuine commitment from each of our countries to taking concrete action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. And what is agreed here in this forum is delivered upon at home. Ladies and gentlemen, Our planet has been extremely badly hurt. The pandemic has plunged millions of people into grief. We are engaged in a relentless daily battle, facing the unseen and the uncertain, head-on, refusing to surrender. We have lost grandparents, parents and children in the deadly duel against the virus. Nurses, doctors, health workers have fallen victim. We believe that a vaccine is near and that we can stop an evil no one ever wanted. We will recover. Governments and world leaders must acknowledge mistakes and be prepared going forward so that our health systems can face crises, such as the one we now face. We can and must help each other, but we must learn from this frightful situation that beyond recovery, we must build a new society \\u2014 one that is more supportive, equitable and just. Together, as nations united, we will build the future we want. Let us make no mistake \\u2014 multilateral action is the right path. Thank you very much. \",\n\"{'Action': 5.93354143596514e-10, 'ActionObject': 3.530707115562137e-10, 'AgendaStatus': 2.4877058191208334e-09, 'Body': 2.5939450240541895e-12, 'Clarification': 2.3734503251660044e-09, 'Conclusion': 9.261326427978389e-11, 'Election': 2.5737236786227413e-09, 'General': 1.0, 'Introduction': 3.278483262647569e-09, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.906258567136888e-10, 'MeetingLocation': 4.442822221228937e-10, 'MeetingNumber': 5.2536655581469915e-11, 'MeetingSegment': 5.382935763798002e-10, 'MeetingStatus': 7.908321775218496e-10, 'OralStatement': 1.297154605950368e-09, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.9705687909498124e-10, 'RVRequested': 3.2241186716935877e-12, 'RVTaken': 1.1629868075513361e-11, 'Session': 1.1831101376369446e-10, 'Sponsorship': 6.348478687190351e-11, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 5.6078159477168654e-11, 'Vote': 6.618749992526318e-10, 'VotingIntention': 1.934952864601769e-09}\",\n[[\"Laurentino Cortizo Cohen\", \"PERSON\"], [\"the Republic of Panama\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Volkan Bozkir\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Secretary-General\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"decades\", \"DATE\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"One\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Panama\", \"UNPE\"], [\"144\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"1,700\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Zandaam\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Rotterdam\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Panama\", \"UNPE\"], [\"more than 30\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"millions\", \"CARDINAL\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 901,\n            'f': \"901\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.7-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 118,\n            'f': \"118\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9964764714241028,\n            'f': \"0.9964764714241028\",\n        },\n\"OralStatement\",\n\"Annex XIV [Original: Mongolian; English translation provided by the delegation] \",\n\"{'Action': 7.793380063958466e-06, 'ActionObject': 5.9719252021750435e-05, 'AgendaStatus': 3.8922479461689363e-07, 'Body': 6.4284818108717445e-06, 'Clarification': 1.8766961147775874e-05, 'Conclusion': 1.8051590814138763e-05, 'Election': 7.018390757451698e-09, 'General': 2.8839934884672402e-08, 'Introduction': 3.4669955708416245e-12, 'MeetingDateTime': 2.35969409345671e-07, 'MeetingLocation': 2.3039241625610885e-07, 'MeetingNumber': 1.2030710649924004e-07, 'MeetingSegment': 5.740735105064232e-07, 'MeetingStatus': 5.817402097818558e-07, 'OralStatement': 0.9964764714241028, 'PresidingOfficer': 2.0775361875280396e-08, 'RVRequested': 3.8570316718278264e-08, 'RVTaken': 0.00011633457324933261, 'Session': 4.743429144582478e-06, 'Sponsorship': 0.0032604720909148455, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.4714954466608106e-08, 'Vote': 1.813896949309779e-10, 'VotingIntention': 2.90344214590732e-05}\",\n[]],\n [{\n            'v': 902,\n            'f': \"902\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.7-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 119,\n            'f': \"119\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9999996423721313,\n            'f': \"0.9999996423721313\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Address by Mr. Battulga Khaltmaa, President of Mongolia Mr. President, Secretary-General, Distinguished delegates, Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to convey my heartfelt congratulations to you, Mr. President, upon your election as the President of the current session of the General Assembly. I pledge my delegation\\u2019s full support and cooperation in the discharge of your onerous responsibilities. This year the member States are proudly celebrating the 75th anniversary of the United Nations. The UN is the optimal structure of multilateral cooperation. It was, indeed, a tremendous achievement when the world\\u2019s nations united under the spirit of the UN Charter, set out to resolve their differences and hurdles through negotiations and cooperation. Along with progress and development came complex and formidable challenges. Our responsibility to address and overcome them has equally increased. The most glaring example is the current 75th session of the UN General Assembly, which is taking place amid a worldwide fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. In today\\u2019s interdependent world, infectious diseases are spreading exponentially, adversely affecting the economy, social welfare, humanitarian causes, security and human rights. It is a huge lesson and warning that humankind has been caught off guard and swept by the pandemic in the 21st century with its highly developed medical science. In this time of hardship, multilateralism has taken on an even more significant role. There is a critical need for networked, inclusive and well-timed responses based on unity and cooperation. We have no doubt that upon release of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine, the United Nations and its system organizations will play a major role in ensuring equal access to the vaccine for developing and least developed countries, as well as vulnerable groups, such as children, women, the elderly and indigenous peoples. We call on international financial organizations and developed countries to continue their support and assistance to developing countries with limited resources and weak social protection systems in their economic recovery and fight against the deadly pandemic. Mr. President, This year ushered in the Decade of Action to deliver the SDGs. However, it is also the year where COVID-19 restrictions and quarantine are in place worldwide, and the pandemic has not only aggravated the existing challenges, but also reversed some of the hard-won gains made since 2015. Thus, all Governments need to act decisively to fight the pandemic, step up their efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals and fulfill their responsibilities in a more innovative and flexible way. As a result of a timely containment strategy, mobilization of all possible resources while taking into account the lessons learnt from others, Mongolia has so far no local transmission and no pandemic-related death. The pandemic, climate change and other threats that have raised alarm worldwide keep reminding humankind of the overriding need to cherish the Earth and live in harmony with nature. The tradition of treasuring, cherishing and protecting the Earth is deeply embedded in the nomadic way of life and the national identity of Mongols. Interdependence between humans and the natural world is at the root of human existence. To this day we have done everything not to bend down under the overwhelming forces of nature. However, our struggle was not to adapt to nature, but rather to defeat it. Day by day we realize that the fight to win is what is causing defeat, while the fight to seek harmony is the foundation of our existence. The fact that Mongolia is one of the few countries with zero local transmission of COVID-19 can be traced to our centuries-long tradition of living in harmony with nature. We need to unite our minds and forces to live in concord with nature, rather than dominate it with the help of technological progress. In fact, nations around the world owe a duty to future generations to protect the Earth and ensure that every individual leads an eco-friendly life. Mr. President, For the past 75 years, the United Nations has been fulfilling its responsibility of uniting the world\\u2019s nations under one roof and steering them towards growth and development. However, the need for the UN to be more in sync with changing environment, enhance its work and change its working methods is nothing but compelling, if it is to rise to the emerging challenges of international relations. It must take even more innovative and bold action to that end. Let us joint efforts to build a reinvigorated United Nations and grow together for the sake of Mother Earth and peace and prosperity of all humankind! I thank you for attention. \",\n\"{'Action': 2.250736841347134e-08, 'ActionObject': 1.0386138171725179e-08, 'AgendaStatus': 5.1089998009956616e-08, 'Body': 1.5317326573782708e-10, 'Clarification': 4.3214289036086484e-08, 'Conclusion': 2.0684820523086955e-09, 'Election': 2.3736953735919997e-08, 'General': 0.9999996423721313, 'Introduction': 6.701502286432515e-08, 'MeetingDateTime': 4.413960752458479e-09, 'MeetingLocation': 1.1036244806916784e-08, 'MeetingNumber': 1.5810039943886522e-09, 'MeetingSegment': 3.629650180414501e-08, 'MeetingStatus': 1.4297117267858539e-08, 'OralStatement': 4.318701485317433e-08, 'PresidingOfficer': 6.8638881245419725e-09, 'RVRequested': 9.392036454114461e-11, 'RVTaken': 5.273042003040018e-10, 'Session': 2.383439001718557e-09, 'Sponsorship': 1.6663159740915034e-09, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 3.6806802050648457e-09, 'Vote': 3.962192351991689e-09, 'VotingIntention': 5.097874478110498e-08}\",\n[[\"Battulga Khaltmaa\", \"PERSON\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"This year\", \"DATE\"], [\"75th\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"75th\", \"ORDINAL\"], [\"today\", \"DATE\"], [\"the 21st century\", \"DATE\"], [\"This year\", \"DATE\"], [\"the Decade of Action\", \"DATE\"], [\"the year\", \"DATE\"], [\"2015\", \"DATE\"], [\"2030\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"Mongols\", \"PERSON\"], [\"this day\", \"DATE\"], [\"Mongolia\", \"UNPE\"], [\"zero\", \"CARDINAL\"], [\"past 75\", \"PARA\"], [\"one\", \"CARDINAL\"]]],\n [{\n            'v': 903,\n            'f': \"903\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.7-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 120,\n            'f': \"120\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0.9617013335227966,\n            'f': \"0.9617013335227966\",\n        },\n\"Action\",\n\"Annex XV \",\n\"{'Action': 0.9617013335227966, 'ActionObject': 0.00014400652435142547, 'AgendaStatus': 5.214197518199626e-09, 'Body': 0.0022727795876562595, 'Clarification': 1.0078954346681712e-06, 'Conclusion': 2.0779220122335573e-08, 'Election': 5.001731187803671e-05, 'General': 1.1718163106522184e-09, 'Introduction': 6.214385017862256e-13, 'MeetingDateTime': 6.852453680039616e-06, 'MeetingLocation': 1.4896020729793236e-05, 'MeetingNumber': 6.0718521126545966e-06, 'MeetingSegment': 2.3883951143943705e-05, 'MeetingStatus': 0.0011553248623386025, 'OralStatement': 0.0005822325474582613, 'PresidingOfficer': 1.0086064605729916e-07, 'RVRequested': 2.0193812133584288e-07, 'RVTaken': 0.00030142045579850674, 'Session': 0.03371640667319298, 'Sponsorship': 2.3357619284070097e-05, 'TemporaryPresidingOfficer': 2.3640216895159938e-08, 'Vote': 1.3252970276766973e-08, 'VotingIntention': 9.3256788957774e-09}\",\n[]],\n [{\n            'v': 904,\n            'f': \"904\",\n        },\n\"A_75_PV.7-EN.txt\",\n{\n            'v': 121,\n            'f': \"121\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 1.0,\n            'f': \"1.0\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Address by Mr. David Kabua, President of the Republic of the Marshall Islands Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Excellencies, I have the honor to bring you the warm greetings of Iakwe from the Republic of the Marshall Islands. We find the world in an unprecedented crisis - bearing witness not only to a frightening pandemic and its accompanying economic fallout, but also to deep fractures in fundamental international cooperation. As we all reflect on the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, we must realize that continuing with a \\u201cbusiness as usual\\u201d approach risks further inaction at the very moment where the world needs the opposite. Without increased leadership, the consequences for shared responsibility will be catastrophic - be the issue the financial crisis, public health, security tensions, or climate change. As a small island developing state, we can often see threats earlier or more sharply than our larger partner nations - and in the Pacific we can readily recall the deeper history of the Second World War, and the very reasons why the UN was founded. But to rise to meet contemporary challenges, the UN must improve its political relevance and be truly \\u201cfit for purpose\\u201d in both messaging and delivery. Mr. President, The Republic of the Marshall Islands remains one of the very few nations in the world without a single confirmed case of Covid-19. Like some of our neighbors, we undertook early measures which avoided exposure to our vulnerable population - but which have left us in a deep isolation. Our substantial populations living abroad have been exposed to serious outbreaks. And as our borders remain largely closed, we have struggled to see friends and relatives in danger and pain. Not just in our own population, but around the world, communities are all facing serious challenges - and it is an essential point of humanity that none of us is spared in our suffering. The Pacific Islands Forum, and many multilateral and key bilateral partners have already delivered important assistance to bolster our medical capacity to address outbreaks. Yet we remain in a sharp and growing economic crisis - as one of the busiest tuna ports in the world, our economy is closely - and uniquely - dependent upon fisheries. And the very Covid measures which keep our population safe are also having an adverse impact on our revenue streams. We are fragile, and cutbacks are throwing us backwards in our basic development, at the very time we must be moving forward. It is vital that the international system strengthen approaches which recognize targeted island-tailored economic recovery strategies. We join many others in seeking to \\u201cbuild back better\\u201d with green resilience through a range of sustainable approaches to benefit key social sectors and the environment, actions we are already taking - but I am also increasingly concerned that without a sharp rise in leadership and multilateral cooperation, we place in doubt the prospect of building back at all. Mr. President, In these trying moments, the International community cannot forsake core human rights which, regardless of development status, remain universal. As a new member of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, we feel frustrated by the gap between ideals and realities. While there remains a growing list of bad actors who may be far beyond facilitative approaches, the Council must also continue to strengthen its ability to listen closely to vulnerable nations seeking good faith reform and progress. We know from our own history and experience the tragic results which can occur when the voices of the most vulnerable are unheard, or when politics clouds clear reality. The Marshall Islands is particularly concerned that not all are held to full account for human rights obligations - and systematic violations, including those of the largest powers. While UN efforts to effectively address human rights need continual strengthening, we find unacceptable the persistent efforts to rewrite basic human dignity into an alleged \\u201cwin win\\u201d language which devalues individual rights. Even if we are in a minority, we will not be silent on this matter. Mr. President, We reaffirm the 2019 BOE Declaration of the Pacific Islands Forum which establishes a contemporary pathway for regional security. It is vital that, as Small Island developing states, we work with democratic partners to maintain and strengthen our security as truly independent nations not subject to the forceful influence of larger powers. The Marshall Islands underscores the complex security environment in our Pacific region, and the need for a stronger focus on emerging and cross-cutting security drivers within fragile states, including climate change. We want to underscore the urgent need for tangible and text-based efforts towards UN Security Council reform. Mr. President, The wider Marshall Islands is a nation which is over 99 per cent ocean. We join our fellow Pacific nations in building upon our traditional cultural roles as stewards of the ocean. While small island developing states have a unique role in oceans discussions, a wider global response is needed to ensure that our youngest and future generations will benefit from healthy oceans. The Pacific islands have taken a leading role in working towards more sustainable tuna fishing which also ensures human rights, and a key source of global food security. Yet here too stronger international leadership and political commitment is needed. The economic lifeline in the Pacific is truly fisheries, and we urge for stronger and targeted fisheries development strategies from global finance sources - as a means towards a sustainable and truly secure future economy. This is what we intend as a \\u201cblue Pacific.\\u201d In this context, we also call on and urge the international community for a more coordinated front, through a UN platform, to combat Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing and related activities. We look forward to realizing a rescheduled UN Oceans Summit in Portugal, as well as the Our Oceans conference in Palau later this year. Mr. President, Climate change is the single greatest threat to the peoples of the Pacific, including in low-lying atoll nations like the Marshall Islands. Curbing emissions now is at the core of the Paris Agreement. But binding words are not enough \\u2013 change will not come from words alone. Change relies on my fellow UN members, major emitters especially, delivering ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions this year. It relies on us all seizing the opportunity posed by the unprecedented scale of economic recovery to create a zero-carbon future. It relies on solidarity, and the resources for us all to build a better future. Change relies on protecting the most vulnerable, because those on the frontline \\u2014 whether healthcare workers battling the pandemic or small island nations sounding the alarm on climate change \\u2014 are critical to the survival of us all. Small island and atoll nations like mine do not have time for paper promises. Adaptation to climate change will hold off the worst impacts if the world lives up to its promise of 1.5C. But adaptation is also a complex goal at a time when we often struggle to deliver the basics, and requires finances just as our economy is reeling from COVID-19\\u2019s effects. There are two things we need to secure our future: for the world to help us adapt to the changes that will come with a 1.5-degree temperature rise, and to make sure that that is the limit. Mr. President, As a former strategic UN Trusteeship, the Marshall Islands knows all too well the consequences of inaction by the international system. Between 1946 and 1958, 67 large-scale nuclear weapons were tested in the Marshall Islands including many authorized by two UN resolutions. This remains a lasting legacy which is also a contemporary challenge passed down through generations as a significant human rights challenge. No other people should ever have to bear the burdens which we know from nuclear exposure. We remain a beacon for stronger international effort to reduce and eliminate nuclear risk. Real results, not symbolic lip service, is needed to unpack and address the often complex situations which often accompany nuclear risk. In particular, we remain alarmed over recent events in North Korea, and call for full implementation of UN Security Council resolutions. Mr. President, As small island developing states, the Marshall Islands and our neighbors are forever reminding the UN system and partner nations of the need for island- based strategies which fit our truly unique character. Implementation of the SAMOA Pathway for SIDS remains uneven throughout the UN system, and too often we are left with one-size fits all approaches. Next year we will present our Voluntary National Review of progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We expect to see strong steps forward, including the recent adoption of our national strategic development plan. Yet despite our ambition, so much still remains to be done in further developing an effective UN system which is truly \\u201cfit for island purpose\\u201d. Mr. President, The world cannot simply ignore Taiwan, as I can assure it in fact exists, and we must have open minds to ensure the 23 million people of Taiwan are not left behind, nor their humanitarian contributions taken for granted. Taiwan should be allowed to participate in an equal and dignified manner within the UN system, including the WHO, ICAO and the UNFCCC, as well as activities related to the SDGs. The vital civic space of UN premises should be opened for visits and attendance of meetings as well as for the media, regardless of origin. Mr. President, These are indeed difficult and trying times for international cooperation. Small and vulnerable nations cannot alone move the world. But as small nations, we often have a unique role in realizing creative and dynamic approaches. The UN setting is vital, and as member states we cannot let it further risk irrelevance at the hour when it is most needed. Optimism remains, and the truest test of character is under adversity. Urgent action by all is needed to better act with conviction- and compassion.
